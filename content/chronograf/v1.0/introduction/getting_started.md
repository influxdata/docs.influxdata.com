This guide shows how to download, install, and start visualizing data with Chronograf.

## Download and Install Chronograf
Follow the instructions in the Chronograf Downloads section on the [Downloads page](https://influxdata.com/downloads/#chronograf).

## Start the Chronograf Server
How you start Chronograf depends on how you installed it:

#### Debian or RPM package
```
sudo service chronograf start
```
Note that the Chronograf startup script needs root permission to ensure that it can write to `/var/log`, but the executable runs as a normal user.

#### macOS via [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/)
* Run Chronograf manually on the command line:

    ```
chronograf
    ```

* To have launchd start homebrew/binary/chronograf at login:

    ```
ln -sfv /usr/local/opt/chronograf/*.plist ~/Library/LaunchAgents
    ```

    Then to load homebrew/binary/chronograf now:

    ```
launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/homebrew.mxcl.chronograf.plist
    ```

#### Standalone macOS binary
Assuming you're working with Chronograf version 0.13, from the `chronograf-0.13/` directory:
```
./chronograf-0.13-darwin_amd64
```

Check to see that Chronograf is running at http://127.0.0.1:10000.
If this is the first time you've started Chronograf, you'll see this:

![Add new server](/img/chronograf/v1.0/add-new-server.png)

> **NOTE:** By default, Chronograf runs on localhost port `10000`.
Those settings are configurable; see the [configuration file](/chronograf/v1.0/administration/configuration/) to change them and to see the other configuration options.

Now that you've got everything installed and running it's time to start visualizing your data in Chronograf!

## Add your first Server
Direct Chronograf to your InfluxDB data by adding a server:

1.
Click the `Add new server` button.

2.
Fill out the form with the relevant information.
In this step the only required fields are `NICKNAME`, `HOST`, and `PORT`.

In the example below, we've called our server `InfluxDB-1` and it's running on `localhost` on port `8086` (the default `HOST` and `PORT` for InfluxDB).
<br>
<br>

3.
Click the `Add` button.

In the image below, notice that Chronograf is now aware of our InfluxDB server `InfluxDB-1`.
<br>
<br>

Click `Done` in the top left corner and move on to the next section to create your first graph.
You can always return to the `Servers` page by clicking on the gear in the top right corner.

## Create your first Visualization
It's time to graph your data.
In the next steps, we'll create an example graph that shows the average idle CPU percentage grouped by CPU tag and by one minute time intervals.
If you'd like to follow along, see [Getting Started with Telegraf](https://docs.influxdata.com/telegraf/v1.0/introduction/getting-started-telegraf/) to get the data we use in this section.

1.
Click `Add Visualization` and name your graph in the `New Graph` window.
We'll call our graph `Average idle CPU usage`.

2.
Click the `Save` button.

3.
Choose the server, [database](/influxdb/v1.0/concepts/glossary/#database), and [retention policy](/influxdb/v1.0/concepts/glossary/#retention-policy-rp) that you want to work with:
<br>
<br>
![Server Tray](/img/chronograf/v1.0/server-tray.png)

In this example, we're working with the the server `InfluxDB-1`, the database `telegraf`, and the retention policy `default`.

4.
Create your query.

To create a [query](/influxdb/v1.0/concepts/glossary/#query), you can either use the Query Builder or, if you're already familiar with InfluxQL, you can manually enter the query in the text input.
In this step, we manually enter the following query:

```
SELECT mean(usage_idle) FROM cpu WHERE time > now() - 10m GROUP BY time(1m), cpu
```

Our query calculates the average of the field key `usage_idle` in the measurement `cpu`, and it `GROUPs BY` the tag `cpu` and by one minute intervals. The query asks for data that fall within the past 10 minutes.

Click `Done` in the top right corner to complete your graph, and move on to the next section to create your first dashboard.

## Create your first Dashboard
Now that we have a graph we want to add it to a dashboard.

1.
Move to the `DASHBOARDS` tab at the top of your screen.

2.
Click `+` and name your dashboard in the `New Dashboard` window.
We'll call our dashboard `Idle CPU usage`.

Because our dashboard has no visualizations, it looks like this:
<br>
<br>
![Add Graph to Dashboard](/img/chronograf/v1.0/add-graph-to-dash.png)

3.
Click the `Add Visualization` button.

4.
We want to add the graph we made in the section above so we click `Add From Existing Visualizations`.
<br>
<br>
![Add From Existing Graphs](/img/chronograf/v1.0/add-from-existing-graphs.png)

5.
Select `Average idle CPU usage` and click the `Add Visualizations to Dash` button in the top right corner.
<br>
<br>
![Select Graph For Dash](/img/chronograf/v1.0/select-graph-for-dash.png)

That takes us back to our new dashboard!
One visualization on a dashboard isn't spectacularly interesting, so we've added a couple more graphs to show you some of the possibilities:

![Sample Dashboard](/img/chronograf/v1.0/sample-dashboard.png)

And that's it!
You now have the foundation for building beautiful data visualizations and dashboards with Chronograf.
