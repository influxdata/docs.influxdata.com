# Introduction

InfluxEnterprise offers highly scalable clusters on your infrastructure
and a management UI for working with clusters.
This guide will get you up and running with an InfluxEnterprise cluster and
[web console](/enterprise/v1.0/concepts/glossary/#web-console).

## Requirements

To get started, you'll need the license key that you received at
[InfluxPortal](https://portal.influxdata.com/) as well as several servers.
The steps below set up a five server cluster; three servers are
[meta nodes](/enterprise/v1.0/concepts/glossary/#meta-node) and
two serve as [data nodes](/enterprise/v1.0/concepts/glossary#data-node).
The data nodes servers will need to be able to reach `portal.influxdata.com`
on port `80` or `443`.

Please note that there is no requirement to use that number of servers.
The meta and data processes can run on the same or different servers.
For high availability and redundancy your cluster should have:

* at least three meta nodes
* an odd number of meta nodes
* at least two data nodes

> **Note:** By default, data and meta nodes communicate with each other on
ports `8091` and `8088`.
In a clustered setup you’ll want to configure a load balancer to point to the
data nodes on port `8086`, the default port for the
[HTTP API](https://docs.influxdata.com/influxdb/v1.0/tools/api/) for writing and
querying data.

# Cluster setup

## Modify the /etc/hosts file

Add your servers' hostnames and IP addresses to **each** server's `/etc/hosts`
file (the hostnames are representative):

```
<Meta_1_IP> enterprise-meta-01
<Meta_2_IP> enterprise-meta-02
<Meta_3_IP> enterprise-meta-03
<Data_1_IP> enterprise-data-01
<Data_2_IP> enterprise-data-02
```

> **Verification steps:**
>
Before proceeding with the installation, verify on each server that the other
servers are resolvable. Here is an example set of shell commands using `ping`:
>
    ping -qc 1 enterprise-meta-01
    ping -qc 1 enterprise-meta-02
    ping -qc 1 enterprise-meta-03
    ping -qc 1 enterprise-data-01
    ping -qc 1 enterprise-data-02

If there are any connectivity issues resolve them before proceeding with the
installation.
A healthy cluster requires that every meta and data node can communicate
with every other meta and data node.
## Set up, configure, and start the meta servers

On all three meta servers:

### 1. Download and install the meta server package

#### Ubuntu & Debian (64-bit)
```
wget https://s3.amazonaws.com/influx-enterprise/releases/influxdb-meta_1.0.1-c1.0.1_amd64.deb
sudo dpkg -i influxdb-meta_1.0.1-c1.0.1_amd64.deb
```

#### RedHat & CentOS (64-bit)
```
wget https://s3.amazonaws.com/influx-enterprise/releases/influxdb-meta-1.0.1_c1.0.1.x86_64.rpm
sudo yum localinstall influxdb-meta-1.0.1_c1.0.1.x86_64.rpm
```

### 2. Edit the configuration file

In `/etc/influxdb/influxdb-meta.conf`, set:

* `hostname` to the meta node’s hostname
* `registration-enabled` to `true`
* `registration-server-url` to the full URL of the server that will run the InfluxEnterprise web console.
You must fully specify the protocol, IP or hostname, and port.
Entering the IP or hostname alone will lead to errors.
* `license-key` to the license key you received on [InfluxPortal](https://portal.influxdata.com/)

```
reporting-disabled = false
bind-address = ""
hostname = "<enterprise-meta-0x>" #✨

[enterprise]
 registration-enabled = true #✨
 registration-server-url = "http://<web-console-server-IP>:3000" #✨
 license-key = "<your_license_key>" #✨
 license-path = ""

[meta]
 dir = "/var/lib/influxdb/meta"
 bind-address = ":8089"
 [...]
 pprof-enabled = false
 lease-duration = "1m0s"
```

> **Note:** If you’re using a license file instead of a license key, set the
`license-path` setting to the path of the license file.

### 3. Start the meta node

On sysvinit systems, enter:
```
service influxdb-meta start
```

On systemd systems, enter:
```
sudo systemctl start influxdb-meta
```

> **Verification steps:**
>
Check to see that the process is running by entering:
>
    ps aux | grep -v grep | grep influxdb-meta
>
You should see output similar to:
>
    influxdb  3207  0.8  4.4 483000 22168 ?        Ssl  17:05   0:08 /usr/bin/influxd-meta -config /etc/influxdb/influxdb-meta.conf

<br>


> **Note:** It is possible to start the cluster with a single meta node but you
must pass the `-single-server` flag when starting the single meta node.
Please note that a cluster with only one meta node is **not** recommended for
production environments.

Move on to the next section to set up the data servers.

## Set up, configure, and start the data servers

On each data server:

### 1. Download and install the data server package

#### Ubuntu & Debian (64-bit)
```
wget https://s3.amazonaws.com/influx-enterprise/releases/influxdb-data_1.0.1-c1.0.1_amd64.deb
sudo dpkg -i influxdb-data_1.0.1-c1.0.1_amd64.deb
```

#### RedHat & CentOS (64-bit)
```
wget https://s3.amazonaws.com/influx-enterprise/releases/influxdb-data-1.0.1_c1.0.1.x86_64.rpm
sudo yum localinstall influxdb-data-1.0.1_c1.0.1.x86_64.rpm
```

### 2. Edit the configuration file

In `/etc/influxdb/influxdb.conf`, set:

* `hostname` to the data nodes’s hostname (you must manually add this setting)
* `license-key` to the license key you received on InfluxPortal
* `auth-enabled` to `true` in the `[http]` section
* `shared-secret` in the `[http]` section to a long pass phrase that will be used to sign tokens (you must manually add this setting for the web console to function with your cluster)

```
# Change this option to true to disable reporting.
reporting-disabled = false
hostname="enterprise-data-0x" #✨
meta-tls-enabled = false

[enterprise]

registration-enabled = false
registration-server-url = ""
license-key = "<your_license_key>" #✨
license-path = ""

[meta]
enabled = false
dir = "/var/lib/influxdb/meta"

[data]
enabled = true
dir = "/var/lib/influxdb/data"

[...]

[http]
 enabled = true
 bind-address = ":8086"
 auth-enabled = true #✨
 log-enabled = true
 write-tracing = false
 pprof-enabled = false
 https-enabled = false
 https-certificate = "/etc/ssl/influxdb.pem"
 shared-secret = "long pass phrase used for signing tokens" #✨

[...]

retry-max-interval = "1m0s"
purge-interval = "1h0m0s"
```

> **Note:** If you’re using a license file instead of a license key, set the
`license-path` setting to the path of the license file.

### 3. Start the data node
On sysvinit systems, enter:
```
service influxdb start
```

On systemd systems, enter:
```
sudo systemctl start influxdb
```

> **Verification steps:**
>
Check to see that the process is running by entering:
>
    ps aux | grep -v grep | grep influxdb
>
You should see output similar to:
>
    influxdb  2706  0.2  7.0 571008 35376 ?        Sl   15:37   0:16 /usr/bin/influxd -config /etc/influxdb/influxdb.conf


Move on to the next section to join all servers to a cluster.

## Join the nodes to the cluster

### 1. Connect the meta nodes to the cluster

From `enterprise-meta-01`, enter:
```
influxd-ctl join enterprise-meta-01:8091

influxd-ctl join enterprise-meta-02:8091

influxd-ctl join enterprise-meta-03:8091
```

> **Note:** Please make sure that you specify the fully qualified host name of
the meta node during the join process.
Please do not specify `localhost` as this can cause cluster connection issues.

The expected output is:
```
Added meta node x at enterprise-meta-0x:8091
```

> **Verification steps:**
>
Issue the following command on any meta node:
>
    influxd-ctl show
>
The expected output is:
>
    Meta Nodes
    ==========
    TCP Address
    enterprise-meta-01:8091
    enterprise-meta-02:8091
    enterprise-meta-03:8091

Note that your cluster must have at least three meta nodes.
If you do not see your meta nodes in the output, please retry adding them to
the cluster.

### 2. Connect the data nodes to the cluster

From `enterprise-meta-01`, enter:
```
influxd-ctl add-data enterprise-data-01:8088

influxd-ctl add-data enterprise-data-02:8088
```

The expected output is:
```
Added data node y at enterprise-data-0x:8088
```

> **Verification steps:**
>
Issue the following command on any meta node:
>
    influxd-ctl show
>
The expected output is:
>
    Data Nodes
    ==========
    ID   TCP Address
    4    enterprise-data-01:8088
    5    enterprise-data-02:8088    
>
    Meta Nodes
    ==========
    TCP Address
    enterprise-meta-01:8091
    enterprise-meta-02:8091
    enterprise-meta-03:8091

Note that your cluster must have at least two data nodes.
If you do not see your data nodes in the output, please retry adding them
to the cluster.

# Web Console setup

<dt> Please set up the web console **after** you've set up your cluster.
Installing the web console before your cluster can cause unexpected behaviors.
</dt>

## Install the InfluxEnterprise Web Console

Install the InfluxEnterprise web console on one of your cluster's servers or on
a separate server.

#### Ubuntu & Debian (64-bit)
```
wget https://s3.amazonaws.com/influx-enterprise/releases/influx-enterprise_1.0.1_amd64.deb
sudo dpkg -i influx-enterprise_1.0.1_amd64.deb
```
#### RedHat & CentOS (64-bit)
```
wget https://s3.amazonaws.com/influx-enterprise/releases/influx-enterprise-1.0.1.x86_64.rpm
sudo yum localinstall influx-enterprise-1.0.1.x86_64.rpm
```
> **Notes:**
>
* For other distributions, visit
[InfluxPortal](https://portal.influxdata.com/licenses) and click `View License`.
* By default, the InfluxEnterprise Web Console uses SQLite for
installations.
If you'd prefer to use PostgreSQL, please see
[Install the InfluxEnterprise Web Console with PostgreSQL](#install-the-influxenterprise-web-console-with-postgresql).
Note that using PostgreSQL requires additional steps.

## Setup Steps

### 1. Edit the configuration file

In `/etc/influx-enterprise/influx-enterprise.conf`, set:

* the first `url` setting to your server’s IP address
* `license_key` to the license key you received on [InfluxPortal](https://portal.influxdata.com/)
* `shared-secret` in the `[influxdb]` section to the same pass phrase that you used in your data servers' configuration files

```
url = "http://<your_server's_IP_address>:3000" #✨

hostname = "localhost"
port = "3000"

license-key = "<your_license_key>" #✨
license-file = "/path/to/license"

[influxdb]
shared-secret = "long pass phrase used for signing tokens" #✨

[smtp]
host = "localhost"
port = "25"
username = ""
password = ""
from_email = "donotreply@example.com"

[database]
# Where is your database?
# NOTE: This version of Enterprise Web currently only supports Postgres >= 9.3 or SQLite3
# url = "postgres://postgres:password@localhost:5432/enterprise" # ENV: DATABASE_URL
url = "sqlite3:///var/lib/influx-enterprise/enterprise.db"
```

>**Note:** If you're using a license file instead of a license key, set the
`license-file` setting to the path of the license file.

### 2. Migrate the configuration file
Run the following command:
```
sudo -u influx-enterprise influx-enterprise migrate --config /etc/influx-enterprise/influx-enterprise.conf
```

The expected output is:
```
2016/07/29 15:43:24 Loading config at /etc/influx-enterprise/influx-enterprise.conf

## Setup Steps
>
### 1. Edit the web console configuration file
In addition to updating the first `url` setting, `license-key`, and
`shared-secret` (see [above](#1-edit-the-configuration-file)), in
`/etc/influx-enterprise/influx-enterprise.conf`:
>
\* Uncomment the first `url` setting in the `[database]` section  
\* Update the password in that first `url` setting to the password for the system's local postgres user  
\* Comment out the second `url` setting in the `[database]` section
>
    [...]
    [database]
    # Where is your database?
    # NOTE: This version of Enterprise Web currently only supports Postgres >= 9.3 or SQLite3
    url = "postgres://postgres:password@localhost:5432/enterprise" # ENV: DATABASE_URL ✨
    # url = "sqlite3:///var/lib/influx-enterprise/enterprise.db" ✨
>
If you’re using a non-SSL version of Postgres, add the `?sslmode=disable`
option to the first `url` setting in the `[database]` section:
>
    url = "postgres://postgres:<your_password>@localhost:5432/enterprise?sslmode=disable"
>
### 2. Migrate the configuration file
Run the following command and enter your postgres Admin User's password when
prompted:
>
    influx-enterprise migrate --config /etc/influx-enterprise/influx-enterprise.conf
