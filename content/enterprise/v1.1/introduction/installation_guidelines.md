Please read the sections below before you begin working with InfluxEnterprise.

## Which installation is right for me?

There are two ways to install InfluxEnterprise.

The first option is the [QuickStart Installation](/enterprise/v1.1/quickstart_installation/) process.
We recommend the QuickStart Installation process for users looking to quickly
get up and running with InfluxEnterprise and for users who are looking to
evaluate the product.
The QuickStart Installation process **is not** designed for use
in a production environment.

The second option is the [Production Installation](/enterprise/v1.1/production_installation/) process.
We recommend the Production Installation process for users looking to deploy
InfluxEnterprise in a production environment.

> **Note:** If you install InfluxEnterprise with the QuickStart Installation process you
will need to reinstall InfluxEnterprise with the Production Installation
process before using the product in a production environment.
