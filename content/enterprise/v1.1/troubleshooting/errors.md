This page documents errors that are specific to the InfluxEnterprise product.
For errors in InfluxDB in general, including query parsing errors and write
parsing errors, please see the
[Error Messages](/influxdb/v1.1/troubleshooting/errors/) documentation for the
open source InfluxDB product.

## Why am I seeing a `503 Service Unavailable` error in my meta node logs?

This is the expected behavior if you haven't joined the meta node to the
cluster.
The `503` errors should stop showing up in the logs once you
[join](/enterprise/v1.1/introduction/meta_node_installation/#join-the-meta-nodes-to-the-cluster)
the meta node to the cluster.

## Why am I seeing a `409` error in some of my data node logs?

When you create a
[Continuous Query (CQ)](/influxdb/v1.1/concepts/glossary/#continuous-query-cq)
on your cluster every data node will ask for the CQ lease.
Only one data node can accept the lease.
That data node will have a `200` in its logs.
All other data nodes will be denied the lease and have a `409` in their logs.
This is the expected behavior.

Log output for a data node that is denied the lease:
```
[meta-http] 2016/09/19 09:08:53 172.31.4.132 - - [19/Sep/2016:09:08:53 +0000] GET /lease?name=continuous_querier&node_id=5 HTTP/1.1 409 105 - InfluxDB Meta Client b00e4943-7e48-11e6-86a6-000000000000 380.542Âµs
```
Log output for the data node that accepts the lease:
```

## Why am I seeing `hinted handoff queue not empty` errors in my data node logs?

```
[write] 2016/10/18 10:35:21 write failed for shard 2382 on node 4: hinted handoff queue not empty
```

This error is informational only and does not necessarily indicate a problem in the cluster. It indicates that the node handling the write request currently has data in its local [hinted handoff](/enterprise/v1.1/concepts/clustering/#hinted-handoff) queue for the destination node. Coordinating nodes will not attempt direct writes to other nodes until the hinted handoff queue for the destination node has fully drained. New data is instead appended to the hinted handoff queue. This helps data arrive in chronological order for consistency of graphs and alerts and also prevents unnecessary failed connection attempts between the data nodes. Until the hinted handoff queue is empty this message will continue to display in the logs. Monitor the size of the hinted handoff queues with `ls -lRh /var/lib/influxdb/hh` to ensure that they are decreasing in size.

Note that for some [write consistency](/enterprise/v1.1/concepts/clustering/#write-consistency) settings, InfluxDB may return a write error (500) for the write attempt, even if the points are successfully queued in hinted handoff. Some write clients may attempt to resend those points, leading to duplicate points being added to the hinted handoff queue and lengthening the time it takes for the queue to drain. If the queues are not draining, consider temporarily downgrading the write consistency setting, or pause retries on the write clients until the hinted handoff queues fully drain.

## Why am I seeing `error writing count stats ...: partial write` errors in my data node logs?

```
[stats] 2016/10/18 10:35:21 error writing count stats for FOO_grafana: partial write
```

The `_internal` database collects per-node and also cluster-wide information about the InfluxEnterprise cluster. The cluster metrics are replicated to other nodes using `consistency=all`. For a [write consistency](/enterprise/v1.1/concepts/clustering/#write-consistency) of `all`, InfluxDB returns a write error (500) for the write attempt even if the points are successfully queued in hinted handoff. Thus, if there are points still in hinted handoff, the `_internal` writes will fail the consistency check and log the error, even though the data is in the durable hinted handoff queue and should eventually persist.


## Why am I seeing `queue is full` errors in my data node logs?

This error indicates that the coordinating node that received the write cannot add the incoming write to the hinted handoff queue for the destination node because it would exceed the maximum size of the queue. This error typically indicates a catastrophic condition for the cluster - one data node may have been offline or unable to accept writes for an extended duration.

The controlling configuration settings are in the `[hinted-handoff]` section of the file. `max-size` is the total size in bytes per hinted handoff queue. When `max-size` is exceeded, all new writes for that node are rejected until the queue drops below `max-size`. `max-age` is the maximum length of time a point will persist in the queue. Once this limit has been reached, points expire from the queue. The age is calculated from the write time of the point, not the timestamp of the point.

## Why am I seeing `unable to determine if "hostname" is a meta node` when I try to add a meta node with `influxd-ctl join`?

Meta nodes use the `/status` endpoint to determine the current state of another metanode. A healthy meta node that is ready to join the cluster will respond with a `200` HTTP response code and a JSON string with the following format (assuming the default ports):

`"nodeType":"meta","leader":"","httpAddr":"<hostname>:8091","raftAddr":"<hostname>:8089","peers":null}`

If you are getting an error message while attempting to `influxd-ctl join` a new meta node, it means that the JSON string returned from the `/status` endpoint is incorrect. This generally indicates that the meta node configuration file is incomplete or incorrect. Inspect the HTTP response with `curl -v "http://<hostname>:8091/status"` and make sure that the `hostname`, the `bind-address`, and the `http-bind-address` are correctly populated. Also check the `license-key` or `license-path` in the configuration file of the meta nodes. Finally, make sure that you specify the `http-bind-address` port in the join command, e.g. `influxd-ctl join hostname:8091`.
