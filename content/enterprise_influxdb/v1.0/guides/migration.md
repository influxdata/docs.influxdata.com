The following guide has step-by-step instructions for migrating an OSS InfluxDB
instance into and InfluxEnterprise cluster.

The process assumes that you already have a fully configured InfluxEnterprise cluster
of three or more meta nodes and zero or more data nodes.

Please note that this migration process:

* Deletes all data from any data nodes that are already part of the InfluxEnterprise Cluster
* Will transfer all users from the OSS instance to the InfluxEnterprise Cluster*
* Will **not** transfer any users from the OSS instance to the InfluxEnterprise Web Console
* Requires downtime for writes and reads for the OSS instance

<dt>
\* If you're using an InfluxEnterprise cluster version prior to 0.7.4, the
following steps will **not** transfer users from the OSS instance to the
InfluxEnterprise Cluster.
</dt>

In addition, please refrain from creating a Global Admin user in the InfluxEnterprise Web Console before implementing these steps. If you’ve already created a Global Admin user, contact support.

## Modify the /etc/hosts file

Add the IP and hostname of the OSS instance to the
`/etc/hosts` file on all nodes in the InfluxEnterprise Cluster.
Ensure that all cluster IPs and hostnames are also in the OSS
instance’s `/etc/hosts` file.

**Note:** All node hostnames must be completely resolvable by all
other nodes in the cluster. If you have DNS already setup in your
environment, then this step can be skipped.

## For all existing InfluxEnterprise data nodes:

### 1. Remove the node from the InfluxEnterprise Cluster

From a **meta** node in your InfluxEnterprise Cluster, enter:
```
influxd-ctl remove-data <data_node_hostname>:8088
```
### 2. Delete any existing data

On each **data** node that you dropped from the cluster, enter:
```
sudo rm -rf /var/lib/influxdb/{meta,data,hh}
```

### 3. Create new directories

On each data node that you dropped from the cluster, enter:
```
sudo mkdir /var/lib/influxdb/{data,hh,meta}
```
To ensure the file permissions are correct please run:
```
sudo chown -R influxdb:influxdb /var/lib/influxdb
```

## For the OSS Instance:

### 1. Stop all writes to the OSS Instance

### 2. Stop the influxdb service on the OSS Instance

On sysvinit systems, use the `service` command:
```
sudo service influxdb stop
```

On systemd systems, use the `systemctl` command:
```
sudo systemctl stop influxdb
```

Double check that the service is stopped (the following should return nothing):
```
ps ax | grep influxd
```

### 3. Remove the OSS package

On Debian/Ubuntu systems:
```
sudo apt-get remove influxdb
```

On RHEL/CentOS systems:
```
sudo yum remove influxdb
```

### 4. Update the binary

> **Note:** This step will overwrite your current configuration file.
If you have settings that you’d like to keep, please make a copy of your config file before running the following command.

#### Ubuntu & Debian (64-bit)
```
wget https://dl.influxdata.com/enterprise/releases/influxdb-data_1.0.2-c1.0.4_amd64.deb
sudo dpkg -i influxdb-data_1.0.2-c1.0.4_amd64.deb
```

#### RedHat & CentOS (64-bit)
```
wget https://dl.influxdata.com/enterprise/releases/influxdb-data-1.0.2_c1.0.4.x86_64.rpm
sudo yum localinstall influxdb-data-1.0.2_c1.0.4.x86_64.rpm
```

### 5. Update the configuration file

For the following settings in `/etc/influxdb/influxdb.conf`, set:

* `hostname` to the server’s hostname (you must manually add this setting)
* `license-key` in the `[enterprise]` section to your license key
* `auth-enabled` in the `[http]` section to true
* `shared-secret` in the `[http]` section to your shared secret (you must manually add this setting for the Enterprise Web console to function)

```
# Change this option to true to disable reporting.
reporting-disabled = false
hostname="your-hostname" #✨
meta-tls-enabled = false

[enterprise]

registration-enabled = false
registration-server-url = ""
license-key = "<your_license_key>" #✨
license-path = ""

[meta]
enabled = false
dir = "/var/lib/influxdb/meta"

[data]
enabled = true
dir = "/var/lib/influxdb/data"

[...]

[http]
 enabled = true
 bind-address = ":8086"
 auth-enabled = true #✨
 log-enabled = true
 write-tracing = false
 pprof-enabled = false
 https-enabled = false
 https-certificate = "/etc/ssl/influxdb.pem"
 shared-secret = "long pass phrase used for signing tokens" #✨

[...]

retry-max-interval = "1m0s"
purge-interval = "1h0m0s"
```

### 6. Start the data node

On sysvinit systems, use the `service` command:
```
sudo service influxdb start
```

On systemd systems, use the `systemctl` command:
```
sudo systemctl start influxdb
```

### 7. Add the node to the cluster

From a **meta** node in the cluster, run:
```
influxd-ctl add-data <data-node-hostname>:8088
```
You should see:
```
Added data node y at data-node-hostname:8088
```

Note: it may take a few minutes before the existing data become available in the cluster.

## Final steps

### 1. Add any data nodes that you removed from cluster back into the cluster

From a **meta** node in the InfluxEnterprise Cluster, run:
```
influxd-ctl add-data <the-hostname>:8088
```
Output:
```
Added data node y at the-hostname:8088
```

Finally verify that all nodes are now members of the cluster as expected:

```
influxd-ctl show
```

### 2. Rebalance the cluster

Increase the [replication factor](/enterprise_influxdb/v1.0/concepts/glossary/#replication-factor) on all existing retention polices to the number of data nodes in your cluster.
You can do this with [ALTER RETENTION POLICY](https://docs.influxdata.com/influxdb/v1.0/query_language/database_management/#modify-retention-policies-with-alter-retention-policy).

Next, [rebalance](/enterprise_influxdb/v1.0/features/web-console-features/#cluster-rebalancing) your cluster using the `Rebalance` button on the `Tasks` page.
