InfluxDB writes log output, by default, to `stderr`.
Depending on your use case, this log information can be written to another location.
Some service managers may override this default.

## Running InfluxDB directly

If you run InfluxDB directly, using `influxd`, all logs will be written to `stderr`.
You may redirect this log output as you would any output to `stderr` like so:

```bash
influxdb-meta 2>$HOME/my_log_file # Meta nodes
influxd 2>$HOME/my_log_file # Data nodes
influx-enterprise 2>$HOME/my_log_file # Enterprise Web 
```

## Launched as a service

### sysvinit

If InfluxDB was installed using a pre-built package, and then launched
as a service, `stderr` is redirected to
`/var/log/influxdb/<node-type>.log`, and all log data will be written to
that file.  You can override this location by setting the variable
`STDERR` in the file `/etc/default/<node-type>`.

For example, if on a data node `/etc/default/influxdb` contains:

```bash
STDERR=/dev/null
```

all log data will be discarded.  You can similarly direct output to
`stdout` by setting `STDOUT` in the same file.  Output to `stdout` is
sent to `/dev/null` by default when InfluxDB is launched as a service.

InfluxDB must be restarted to pick up any changes to `/etc/default/<node-type>`.


#### Meta Nodes

For meta nodes the <node-type> is `influxdb-meta`.
The default log file is `/var/log/influxdb/influxdb-meta.log`
The service configuration file is `/etc/default/influxdb-meta`.

#### Data Nodes

For data nodes the <node-type> is `influxdb`.
The default log file is `/var/log/influxdb/influxdb.log`
The service configuration file is `/etc/default/influxdb`.

#### Enterprise Web

For Enterprise Web nodes the <node-type> is `influx-enterprise`.
The default log file is `/var/log/influxdb/influx-enterprise.log`
The service configuration file is `/etc/default/influx-enterprise`.

### systemd

Starting with version 1.0, InfluxDB on systemd systems no longer
writes files to `/var/log/<node-type>.log` by default, and now uses the
system configured default for logging (usually `journald`).  On most
systems, the logs will be directed to the systemd journal and can be
accessed with the command:

```
sudo journalctl -u <node-type>.service
```

Please consult the systemd journald documentation for configuring
journald.

#### Meta Nodes

For data nodes the <node-type> is `influxdb-meta`.
The default log command is `sudo journalctl -u influxdb-meta.service`
The service configuration file is `/etc/default/influxdb-meta`.

#### Data Nodes

For data nodes the <node-type> is `influxdb`.
The default log command is `sudo journalctl -u influxdb.service`
The service configuration file is `/etc/default/influxdb`.

#### Enterprise Web

For data nodes the <node-type> is `influx-enterprise`.
The default log command is `sudo journalctl -u influx-enterprise.service`
The service configuration file is `/etc/default/influx-enterprise`.

## Using logrotate

You can use [logrotate](http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/cosmic/en/man8/logrotate.8.html) 
to rotate the log files generated by InfluxDB on systems where logs are written to flat files.
If using the package install on a sysvinit system, the config file for logrotate is installed in `/etc/logrotate.d`.
You can view the file [here](https://github.com/influxdb/influxdb/blob/master/scripts/logrotate).
