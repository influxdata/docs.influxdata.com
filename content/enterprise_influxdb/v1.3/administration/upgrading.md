## Upgrading from version 1.2.5 to 1.3.3

Version 1.3.3 is a drop-in replacement for version 1.2.5 with no data migration required.

Version 1.3.3 introduces changes to the data node configuration file.
Please update that configuration file to avoid any unnecessary downtime.
The steps below outline the upgrade process and include a list of the required configuration changes.

### Step 0: Back up your cluster before upgrading to version 1.3.
It is recommended to create a full backup of your cluster prior to executing the upgrade. If you are 
already have incremental backups being created as part of your standard operating procedures, you should 
trigger a final incremental backup before proceeding with the upgrade.
<dt>
Note that you need to ensure you have sufficient disk space before triggering the backup.
</dt>
The following command uses the [version 1.2 backup syntax](https://docs.influxdata.com/enterprise_influxdb/v1.2/guides/backup-and-restore/#syntax) 
to create an incremental backup of your cluster and it stores that backup in the current directory.

```
influxd-ctl backup .
```

Otherwise, you should create a full backup before proceeding. 
The following command uses the [version 1.2 backup syntax](https://docs.influxdata.com/enterprise_influxdb/v1.2/guides/backup-and-restore/#syntax) 
to create a full backup of your cluster and it stores that backup in the current directory. 

```
influxd-ctl backup -full .
```

### Step 1: Download the 1.3.3 packages

#### Meta node package download and verification
**Ubuntu & Debian (64-bit)**
```
wget https://dl.influxdata.com/enterprise/releases/influxdb-meta_1.3.3-c1.3.3_amd64.deb
echo "1f532428fc4088209da9470ac46baebbb8ec91419f8d428dc9088b39dacb54d9 influxdb-meta_1.3.3-c1.3.3_amd64.deb" | sha256sum -c
```

**RedHat & CentOS (64-bit)**
```
wget https://dl.influxdata.com/enterprise/releases/influxdb-meta-1.3.3_c1.3.3.x86_64.rpm
echo "4683ec724f53b2ca717436e2e8034a85342e226a4f988a74df37d8cfe6f0d52a influxdb-meta-1.3.3_c1.3.3.x86_64.rpm" | sha256sum -c
```

#### Data node package download
**Ubuntu & Debian (64-bit)**
```
wget https://dl.influxdata.com/enterprise/releases/influxdb-data_1.3.3-c1.3.3_amd64.deb
echo "4ee4eab05f44bec1ffd71c09c5c1b66aa785b4ce7c44bbd5d0e8c5a99ddfa042 influxdb-data_1.3.3-c1.3.3_amd64.deb" | sha256sum -c
```

**RedHat & CentOS (64-bit)**
```
wget https://dl.influxdata.com/enterprise/releases/influxdb-data-1.3.3_c1.3.3.x86_64.rpm
echo "b239b4627e47eb5931851ca31f4f7a7e1c5feb934c982f49572557171b4c08d9 influxdb-data-1.3.3_c1.3.3.x86_64.rpm" | sha256sum -c
```

### Step 2: Install the 1.3.3 packages

#### Meta node package Install

**Ubuntu & Debian (64-bit)**
```
sudo dpkg -i influxdb-meta_1.3.3-c1.3.3_amd64.deb
```

**RedHat & CentOS (64-bit)**
```
sudo yum localinstall influxdb-meta-1.3.3_c1.3.3.x86_64.rpm
```

#### Data node package install

When you run the install command, your terminal asks if you'd like to keep your current configuration file or overwrite your current configuration file with the file for version 1.3.3.
Please keep your current configuration file by entering `N` or `O`;
we update the configuration file with the necessary changes for version 1.3.2 in step 3.

**Ubuntu & Debian (64-bit)**
```
sudo dpkg -i influxdb-data_1.3.3-c1.3.3_amd64.deb
```

**RedHat & CentOS (64-bit)**
```
sudo yum localinstall influxdb-data-1.3.3_c1.3.3.x86_64.rpm
```

### Step 3: Update the data node configuration file

Add:

* [index-version = "inmem"](/enterprise_influxdb/v1.3/administration/configuration/#index-version-inmem) to the `[data]` section
* [wal-fsync-delay = "0s"](/enterprise_influxdb/v1.3/administration/configuration/#wal-fsync-delay-0s) to the `[data]` section
* [max-concurrent-compactions = 0](/enterprise_influxdb/v1.3/administration/configuration/#max-concurrent-compactions-0) to the `[data]` section
* [pool-max-idle-streams = 100](/enterprise_influxdb/v1.3/administration/configuration/#pool-max-idle-streams-100) to the `[cluster]` section
* [pool-max-idle-time = "1m0s"](/enterprise_influxdb/v1.3/administration/configuration/#pool-max-idle-time-1m0s) to the `[cluster]` section
* the [[anti-entropy]](/enterprise_influxdb/v1.3/administration/configuration/#anti-entropy) section:
```
[anti-entropy]
  enabled = true
  check-interval = "30s"
  max-fetch = 10
```

Remove:

* `max-remote-write-connections` from the `[cluster]` section
* the [[admin]](/enterprise_influxdb/v1.3/administration/configuration/#admin) section

Update:

* [cache-max-memory-size](/enterprise_influxdb/v1.3/administration/configuration/#cache-max-memory-size-1073741824) to `1073741824` in the `[data]` section

The new configuration options are set to their default settings.
Follow the links for more information about those options.

### Step 4: Restart the processes

#### Meta node restart
**sysvinit systems**
```
service influxdb-meta restart
```
**systemd systems**
```
sudo systemctl restart influxdb-meta
```

#### Data node Restart
**sysvinit systems**
```
service influxdb restart
```
**systemd systems**
```
sudo systemctl restart influxdb
```

### Step 5: Confirm the upgrade

Check your nodes' version numbers using the `influxd-ctl show` command.
The [`influxd-ctl` tool](/enterprise_influxdb/v1.3/features/cluster-commands/) is available on all meta nodes.

```
~# influxd-ctl show
