## Terminology
Definitions for terms specific to this guide are defined below:

**Standalone event handler:**  
"Standalone" event handlers (also known as "topic handlers") are those added using an
[event handler file](/kapacitor/v1.5/event_handlers/#handler-file) that subscribes to a specified alert topic.
As alerts are published to that topic, the standalone event handler sends alert data to a given endpoint.
How the handler works and to what endpoint data is sent depends on the particular `kind` of handler you are using.

**Inline event handler:**  
"Inline" event handlers are those [used in TICKscripts](/kapacitor/v1.5/event_handlers/#tickscript)
that send alert data directly from the running task.

## Cluster awareness
Currently, Kapacitor Enterprise is only partially cluster-aware.
For example, Nodes in a Kapacitor cluster aren't aware of tasks and TICKscripts
running on other nodes in the cluster.
Tasks need to be defined on each instance you wish the task to run.
However, "standalone" alert handlers only need to be defined on one instance.
Kapacitor will manage the replication of that handler.

## Alert handlers in a cluster
Because nodes in a Kapacitor enterprise cluster are not aware of tasks running on
other nodes, alert data should **not** be sent directly from tasks (TICKscripts).
Doing so will result in duplicate notifications as each node will send the same alert.

Instead, publish alert data to a topic and create a standalone alert handler that subscribes to the topic.
Kapacitor Enterprise handles the replication of standalone handlers across the cluster.
As multiple nodes publish alerts a topic, Kapacitor **deduplicates** the alerts so the
standalone handler will not send duplicate alerts.

## Add alerts to a Kapacitor cluster
To add alerts to your Kapacitor Enterprise cluster without worrying about duplicate alerts,
do the following:

### 1. Publish alert data to a topic
In your TICKscript [AlertNodes](kapacitor/v1.5/nodes/alert_node/), publish alert
data to a topic using the `.topic()` method.

_**TICKscript - Publish alerts to a topic**_
```js
|alert()
  // ...
  .topic('topic-name')
```

### 2. Add the task to each node in your cluster
Since tasks are not replicated across nodes in you cluster, tasks need to be defined on each node.
Login to each node and define a new task using your TICKscript:

```bash
# Pattern
kapacitor define <task-name> -tick <path-to-tickscript-file>

# Example
kapacitor define cpu-alert -tick cpu_alert.tick
```

### 3. Add an alert handler that subscribes to your topic
Standalone alert handlers are defined using [handler files](/kapacitor/v1.5/event_handlers/#handler-file),
simple YAML files that include inforamation necessary for the handler to function.
Below is an example Slack handler file that subcribes to the `topic-name` topic:

_**slack-handler.yml**_
```yaml
id: handler-id
topic: topic-name
kind: slack
options:
  workspace: 'workspace.slack.com'
  channel: '#alerts'
  username: 'kapacitor'
```

Standalone handlers only need to be defined on one node in your cluster.
Kapacitor Enterprise manages the replication of standalone handlers across the cluster.
Login to one of the nodes in your cluster and define your alert handler:

```bash
# Pattern
kapacitor define-topic-handler <path/to/handler.yml>

# From inside a running Kapacitor instance
kapacitor define-topic-handler ./slack-handler.yml
```
