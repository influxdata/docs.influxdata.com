## cluster
A collection of servers running InfluxDB nodes.
All nodes in a cluster have the same users, databases, retention policies, and continuous queries.
See [Clustering](/influxdb/v0.10/guides/clustering/) for how to set up an InfluxDB cluster.

## consensus node
A node running only the consensus service.

See [Cluster Node Configuration](/influxdb/v0.10/clustering/cluster_node_config/).

## consensus service
The InfluxDB service that participates in the raft consensus group.
A cluster must have at least three nodes running the consensus service (consensus or hybrid nodes), but it can have more.
There should be an odd number of nodes running the consensus service in a cluster.

The number of consensus services that can fail before the cluster is degraded is &#8968;n/2 + 1&#8969; where `n` is the number of consensus services in the cluster.
Thus, an even number of consensus services offer no additional redundancy or resiliency.

The consensus service ensures consistency across the cluster for node membership, databases, retention policies, users, continuous queries, shard metadata, and subscriptions.

See [Cluster Node Configuration](/influxdb/v0.10/clustering/cluster_node_config/).

## continuous query (CQ)
An InfluxQL query that runs automatically and periodically within a database.
Continuous queries require a function in the `SELECT` clause and must include a `GROUP BY time()` clause.
See [Continuous Queries](/influxdb/v0.10/query_language/continuous_queries/).

## field
The key-value pair in InfluxDB's data structure that records metadata and the actual data value.
Fields are required in InfluxDB's data structure and they are not indexed - queries on field values scan all points that match the specified time range and, as a result, are not performant relative to tags.

*Query tip:* Compare fields to tags; tags are indexed.

## field key
The key part of the key-value pair that makes up a field.
Field keys are strings and they store metadata.

## field value  
The value part of the key-value pair that makes up a field.
Field values are the actual data; they can be strings, floats, integers, or booleans.
A field value is always associated with a timestamp.

Field values are not indexed - queries on field values scan all points that match the specified time range and, as a result, are not performant.

*Query tip:* Compare field values to tag values; tag values are indexed.

## line protocol
The text based format for writing points to InfluxDB. See [Line Protocol](/influxdb/v0.10/write_protocols/line/).

## measurement  
The part of InfluxDB's structure that describes the data stored in the associated fields.
Measurements are strings.

Related entries: [field](/influxdb/v0.10/concepts/glossary/#field), [series](/influxdb/v0.10/concepts/glossary/#series)

## metastore
Contains internal information about the status of the system. That includes user information, database and shard metadata, and which retention policies are enabled.

## node
An independent `influxd` process.

Related entries: [cluster](/influxdb/v0.10/concepts/glossary/#cluster), [server](/influxdb/v0.10/concepts/glossary/#server)

## point
The part of InfluxDB's data structure that consists of a single collection of fields and tags in a series.
Each point is uniquely identified by its series, [tag
set](/influxdb/v0.10/concepts/glossary/#tag-set), and timestamp.

You cannot store more than one point with the same timestamp and tag set in the same series.
Instead, when you write a new point to the same series with the same timestamp as an existing point in that series, the field set becomes the union of the old field set and the new field set, where any ties go to the new field set.
For an example, see [Frequently Encountered Issues](/influxdb/v0.10/troubleshooting/frequently_encountered_issues/#writing-duplicate-points).

## query
An operation that retrieves data from InfluxDB.
See [Data Exploration](/influxdb/v0.10/query_language/data_exploration/), [Schema Exploration](/influxdb/v0.10/query_language/schema_exploration/), [Database Management](/influxdb/v0.10/query_language/database_management/).

## replication factor  
The attribute of the retention policy that determines how many copies of the data are stored in the cluster.
InfluxDB replicates data across `N` data nodes, where `N` is the replication factor.

To maintain data availability for queries, the replication factor should be less than or equal to the number of data nodes in the cluster:

* Data are fully available when the replication factor is greater than the number of *unavailable* data nodes.
* Data may be unavailable when the replication factor is less than the number of *unavailable* data nodes.

Note that there are no query performance benefits from replication.
Replication is for ensuring data availability when a data node or nodes are unavailable.
See [Database Management](/influxdb/v0.10/query_language/database_management/#create-retention-policies-with-create-retention-policy) for how to set the replication factor.

Related entries: [cluster](/influxdb/v0.10/concepts/glossary/#cluster), [duration](/influxdb/v0.10/concepts/glossary/#duration), [node](/influxdb/v0.10/concepts/glossary/#node), [retention policy](/influxdb/v0.10/concepts/glossary/#retention-policy-rp)

## retention policy (RP)
The part of InfluxDB's data structure that describes for how long InfluxDB keeps data (duration) and how many copies of those data are stored in the cluster (replication factor).
RPs are unique per database and along with the measurement and tag set define a series.

When you create a database, InfluxDB automatically creates a retention policy called `default` with an infinite duration and a replication factor set to the number of nodes in the cluster.
See [Database Management](/influxdb/v0.10/query_language/database_management/#retention-policy-management) for retention policy management.

## schema
How the data are organized in InfluxDB.
The fundamentals of the InfluxDB schema are databases, retention policies, series, measurements, tag keys, tag values, and field keys.
See [Schema Design](/influxdb/v0.10/concepts/schema_and_data_layout/) for more information.

Related entries: [aggregation](/influxdb/v0.10/concepts/glossary/#aggregation), [function](/influxdb/v0.10/concepts/glossary/#function), [transformation](/influxdb/v0.10/concepts/glossary/#transformation)

## series  
The collection of data in InfluxDB's data structure that share a measurement, tag set, and retention policy.


> **Note:** The field set is not part of the series identification!

Related entries: [field set](/influxdb/v0.10/concepts/glossary/#field-set), [measurement](/influxdb/v0.10/concepts/glossary/#measurement), [retention policy](/influxdb/v0.10/concepts/glossary/#retention-policy-rp), [tag set](/influxdb/v0.10/concepts/glossary/#tag-set)

## series cardinality
The count of all combinations of measurements and tags within a given data set.
For example, take measurement `mem_available` with tags `host` and `total_mem`.
If there are 35 different `host`s and 15 different `total_mem` values then series cardinality for that measurement is `35 * 15 = 525`.
To calculate series cardinality for a database add the series cardinalities for the individual measurements together.

## user  
There are two kinds of users in InfluxDB:

* *Admin users* have `READ` and `WRITE` access to all databases and full access to administrative queries and user management commands.
* *Non-admin users* have `READ`, `WRITE`, or `ALL` (both `READ` and `WRITE`) access per database.


When authentication is enabled, InfluxDB only executes HTTP requests that are sent with a valid username and password.
