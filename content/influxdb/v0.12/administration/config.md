The InfluxDB configuration file contains configuration settings specific to a local node.

## Using Configuration Files

The `influxd config` command will print out a new TOML-formatted configuration with all the available configuration options set to their default values.
On POSIX systems, a new configuration file can be generated by redirecting the output of the command to a file.

```bash
influxd config > /etc/influxdb/influxdb.conf.generated
```

Custom settings from an older configuration file can be preserved when generating a new config file using the `-config` option.

```bash
influxd config -config /etc/influxdb/influxdb.conf.old > /etc/influxdb/influxdb.conf.new
```

Use the `-config` option to start InfluxDB using a configuration file.

```bash
influxd -config /etc/influxdb/influxdb.conf.new
```

InfluxDB will use the default configuration settings when no configuration file is provided.
A new configuration file should be generated every time InfluxDB is upgraded.

See the [installation documentation](/influxdb/v0.12/introduction/installation/#generate-a-configuration-file) for more detail on generating and using configuration files.

## Configuration Options

Every configuration section has configuration options.
Every configuration option is optional.
If a configuration option is not provided, its default value will be used.
All configuration options listed below are set to their default value.

>**Note:** This page documents configuration options for the latest official release - the [sample configuration file on GitHub](https://github.com/influxdb/influxdb/blob/master/etc/config.sample.toml) will always be slightly ahead of what is documented here.

## Global Options

### reporting-disabled = false

InfluxData, the company, relies on reported data from running nodes primarily to track the adoption rates of different InfluxDB versions. This data helps InfluxData support the continuing development of InfluxDB. 

The `reporting-disabled` option toggles the reporting of data every 24 hours to `usage.influxdata.com`. Each report includes a randomly-generated identifier, OS, architecture, InfluxDB version, and the number of [databases](/influxdb/v0.12/concepts/glossary/#database), [measurements](/influxdb/v0.12/concepts/glossary/#measurement), and unique [series](/influxdb/v0.12/concepts/glossary/#series). Setting this option to `true` will disable reporting.

>**Note:** No data from user databases is ever transmitted.

## [meta]

This section controls parameters for InfluxDB's metastore,
which stores information on users, databases, retention policies, shards, and
continuous queries.

### dir = "/var/lib/influxdb/meta"

The `meta` directory.
Files in the `meta` directory include: `meta.db` and the `snapshots` directory.

>**Note:** The default directory for macOS installations is `/Users/<username>/.influxdb/meta`

### retention-autocreate = true

Retention policy auto-creation automatically creates a [`default` retention policy](/influxdb/v0.12/concepts/glossary/#retention-policy-rp) when a database is created.
The retention policy is named `default`, has an infinite duration, and is also set as the database's `DEFAULT` retention policy, which is used when a write or query does not specify a retention policy.
Disable this setting to prevent the creation of a `default` retention policy when creating databases.

### logging-enabled = true

Meta logging toggles the logging of messages from the meta service.

### pprof-enabled = false

### lease-duration = "1m0s"

The default duration for leases.

## [data]

This section controls where the actual shard data for InfluxDB lives and how it is flushed from the WAL. `dir` may need to be changed to a suitable place for you system, but the WAL settings are an advanced configuration. The defaults should work for most systems.

### dir = "/var/lib/influxdb/data"

The directory where InfluxDB stores the data.
This directory may be changed.

>**Note:** The default directory for macOS installations is `/Users/<username>/.influxdb/data`

### query-log-enabled = true

The query log enabled setting toggles the logging of parsed queries before execution.
Very useful for troubleshooting, but will log any sensitive data contained within a query.

### cache-max-memory-size = 524288000

The cache maximum memory size is the maximum size (in bytes) a shard's cache can reach before it starts rejecting writes.

### cache-snapshot-memory-size = 26214400

The cache snapshot memory size is the size at which the engine will snapshot the cache and write it to a TSM file, freeing up memory.

### cache-snapshot-write-cold-duration = "1h"

The cache snapshot write cold duration is the length of time at which the engine will snapshot the cache and write it to a new TSM file if the shard hasn't received writes or deletes.

### compact-min-file-count = 3

The compact minimum file count is the minimum number of TSM files that need to exist before a compaction cycle will run.

### compact-full-write-cold-duration = "24h"

he compact full write cold duration is the duration at which the engine will compact all TSM files in a shard if it hasn't received a write or delete.

### max-points-per-block = 1000

The maximum points per block is the maximum number of points in an encoded block in a TSM file.
Larger numbers may yield better compression but could incur a performance peanalty when querying.

## [cluster]

This section contains configuration options for query management.
For more on managing queries, see [Query Management](/v0.12/troubleshooting/query_management/).

### max-concurrent-queries = 0

The maximum number of running queries allowed on your instance.
The default setting (`0`) allows for an unlimited number of queries.

### query-timeout = "0"

The maximum time for which a query can run on your instance before InfluxDB
kills the query.
The default setting (`0`) allows queries to run with no time restrictions.
This setting is a [duration literal](/influxdb/v0.12/query_language/spec/#durations).

### max-select-point = 0

The maximum number of [points](/influxdb/v0.12/concepts/glossary/#point) that a
`SELECT` statement can process.
The default setting (`0`) allows the `SELECT` statement to process an unlimited
number of points.

### max-select-series = 0

The maximum number of [series](/influxdb/v0.12/concepts/glossary/#series) that a
`SELECT` statement can process.
The default setting (`0`) allows the `SELECT` statement to process an unlimited
number of series.

### max-select-buckets = 0

The maximum number of `GROUP BY time()` buckets that a query can process.
The default setting (`0`) allows a query to process an unlimited number of
buckets.

## [retention]

This section controls the enforcement of retention policies for evicting old data.

### enabled = true

Set to `false` to prevent InfluxDB from enforcing retention policies.

### check-interval = "30m"

The rate at which InfluxDB checks to enforce a retention policy.

## [shard-precreation]

Controls the precreation of shards so that shards are available before data arrive.
Only shards that, after creation, will have both a start- and end-time in the future are ever created.
Shards that would be wholly or partially in the past are never precreated.

### enabled = true

### check-interval = "10m"

### advance-period = "30m"

The maximum period in the future for which InfluxDB precreates shards.
The `30m` default should work for most systems.
Increasing this setting too far in the future can cause inefficiencies.


## [monitor]

This section controls InfluxDB's [system self-monitoring](https://github.com/influxdb/influxdb/blob/master/monitor/README.md).

By default, InfluxDB writes the data to the `_internal` database.
If that database does not exist, InfluxDB creates it automatically.
The `DEFAULT` retention policy on the `_internal` database is seven days.
If you want to use a retention policy other than the seven-day retention policy, you must [create](/influxdb/v0.12/query_language/database_management/#retention-policy-management) it.

### store-enabled = true

Set to `false` to disable recording statistics internally.
If set to `false` it will make it substantially more difficult to diagnose issues with your installation.

### store-database = "\_internal"

The destination database for recorded statistics.

### store-interval = "10s"

The interval at which InfluxDB records statistics.

## [admin]

Controls the availability of the built-in, web-based admin interface.

### enabled = true

Set to `false` to disable the admin interface.

### bind-address = ":8083"

The port used by the admin interface.

### https-enabled = false

Set to `true` to enable HTTPS for the admin interface.

>**Note:** HTTPS must be enable for the [[http]](/influxdb/v0.12/administration/config/#http) service for the admin UI to function properly using HTTPS.

### https-certificate = "/etc/ssl/influxdb.pem"

The path of the certificate file.

## [http]

This section controls how InfluxDB configures the HTTP endpoints.
These are the primary mechanisms for getting data into and out of InfluxDB.
Edit the options in this section to enable HTTPS and authentication.
See [Authentication and Authorization](/influxdb/v0.12/administration/authentication_and_authorization/).

### enabled = true

Set to `false` to disable HTTP.
Note that the InfluxDB [command line interface (CLI)](/influxdb/v0.12/tools/shell/) connects to the database using the HTTP API.

### bind-address = ":8086"

The port used by the HTTP API.

### auth-enabled = false

Set to `true` to require authentication.

### log-enabled = true

Set to `false` to disable logging.

### write-tracing = false

Set to `true` to enable logging for the write payload.
If set to `true`, this will duplicate every write statement in the logs and is thus not recommended for general use.

### pprof-enabled = false

Set to `true` to enable [pprof](http://blog.golang.org/profiling-go-programs) on InfluxDB so that it gathers detailed performance information.

### https-enabled = false

Set to `true` to enable HTTPS.

### bind-address = ":2003"

The default port.

### protocol = "tcp"

Set to `tcp` or `udp`.

### consistency-level = "one"

The number of nodes that must confirm the write.
If the requirement is not met the return value will be either `partial write` if some points in the batch fail or `write failure` if all points in the batch fail.
For more information, see the Query String Parameters for Writes section in the [Line Protocol Syntax Reference ](/influxdb/v0.12/write_protocols/write_syntax/).

*The next three options control how batching works.
You should have this enabled otherwise you could get dropped metrics or poor performance.
Batching will buffer points in memory if you have many coming in.*

### separator = "."

This string joins multiple matching 'measurement' values providing more control over the final measurement name.

### tags = ["region=us-east", "zone=1c"]

Default tags that will be added to all metrics.  
These can be overridden at the template level or by tags extracted from metric.

### templates = []

Each template line requires a template pattern.  
It can have an optional filter before the template and separated by spaces.  
It can also have optional extra tags following the template.  
Multiple tags should be separated by commas and no spaces similar to the line protocol format.  
There can be only one default template.
