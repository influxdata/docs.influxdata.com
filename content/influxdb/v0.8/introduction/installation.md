## Ports
By default InfluxDB will use ports `8083`, `8086`, `8090`, and `8099`.
Once you install you can change those ports and other options in the configuration file, which is located at either `/opt/influxdb/shared/config.toml` or `/usr/local/etc/influxdb.conf`

## Reporting

As of version 0.7.1, InfluxDB will report usage data once every 24 hours to m.influxdb.com.
This includes the raft id (randomly generated 8 bytes), the InfluxDB version, the OS, and the architecture (amd64, ARM, etc).
This information is very helpful for our project.
It lets us know how many servers are running out there in the world and, more importantly, which versions.

This is enabled by default.
You can opt-out of this by editing the config file and setting `reporting-disabled = true`.
However, we'd be very grateful if you keep it enabled.

## File Limits

InfluxDB can potentially have many open files.
You will need to up the open file limits on your box.
Pretend like we made it past 1999 and computers can actually handle more than 256 open files, and set the open file limit to `unlimited`.
Basho has a nice [writeup on setting the open file limits](http://docs.basho.com/riak/latest/ops/tuning/open-files-limit/).

Replace the `riak` user with `influxdb` and you should be good to go.
