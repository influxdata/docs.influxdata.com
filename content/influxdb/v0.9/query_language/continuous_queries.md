When writing large amounts of data to InfluxDB, you may often want to downsample the raw data, that is, use `GROUP BY time()` with an InfluxQL [function](/influxdb/v0.9/query_language/functions/) to change the high frequency data into lower frequency data.
Repeatedly running the same queries by hand can be tedious.
InfluxDB's continuous queries (CQ) simplify the downsampling process; CQs run automatically and write the query results to another measurement.

## CQ definition
A CQ is an InfluxQL query that the system runs automatically and periodically within a database.
InfluxDB stores the results of the CQ in a specified [measurement](/influxdb/v0.9/concepts/glossary/#measurement).
CQs require a function in the `SELECT` clause and must include a `GROUP BY time()` clause.

The time ranges of the CQ results have round-number boundaries that are set internally by the database.
There is currently no way for users to alter the start or end times of the intervals.

Only admin users are allowed to work with continuous queries.
For more on user privileges, see [Authentication and Authorization](/influxdb/v0.9/administration/authentication_and_authorization/#user-types-and-their-privileges).

> **Note:** CQs only execute on data received after the CQ's creation.
If you'd like to downsample data written to InfluxDB before the CQ was created, see the examples in [Data Exploration](/influxdb/v0.9/query_language/data_exploration/#downsample-data).

## InfluxQL for creating a CQ
### The `CREATE CONTINUOUS QUERY` statement
```sql
CREATE CONTINUOUS QUERY <cq_name> ON <database_name> BEGIN SELECT <function>(<stuff>)[,<function>(<stuff>)] INTO <different_measurement> FROM <current_measurement> [WHERE <stuff>] GROUP BY time(<interval>)[,<stuff>] END
```

The `CREATE CONTINUOUS QUERY` statement is essentially an InfluxQL query surrounded by `CREATE CONTINUOUS QUERY ON <database_name> BEGIN` and `END`.
Notice that the query portion of the statement differs from a typical `SELECT [...] GROUP BY (time)` statement in two ways:

1.
The `INTO` clause:

    This is where you specify the destination measurement for the query results.

2.
The optional `WHERE` clause:

    Because CQs run on regularly incremented time intervals you don't need to (and shouldn't!) specify a time range in the `WHERE` clause.
When included, the CQ's `WHERE` clause should filter information about tags.

*CQ examples:*

* Create a CQ with one function:

    ```sql
> CREATE CONTINUOUS QUERY minnie ON world BEGIN SELECT min(mouse) INTO min_mouse FROM zoo GROUP BY time(30m) END
    ```

    Once executed, InfluxDB automatically calculates the 30 minute minimum of the field `mouse` in the measurement `zoo`, and it writes the results to the measurement `min_mouse`.
Note that the CQ `minnie` only exists in the database `world`.

* Create a CQ with one function and write the results to another [retention policy](/influxdb/v0.9/concepts/glossary/#retention-policy-rp):

    ```sql
> CREATE CONTINUOUS QUERY minnie_jr ON world BEGIN SELECT min(mouse) INTO world."7days".min_mouse FROM world."1day".zoo GROUP BY time(30m) END
    ```

    The CQ `minnie_jr` acts in the same way as the CQ `minnie`, however, InfluxDB calculates the 30 minute minimum of the field `mouse` in the measurement `zoo` and under the retention policy `1day`, and it automatically writes the results of the query to the measurement `min_mouse` under the retention policy `7days`.

    Combining CQs and retention policies provides a useful way to automatically downsample data and expire the unnecessary raw data.
For a complete discussion on this topic, see [Downsampling and Data Retention](/influxdb/v0.9/guides/downsampling_and_retention/).

* Create a CQ with two functions:

    ```sql
> CREATE CONTINUOUS QUERY minnie_maximus ON world BEGIN SELECT min(mouse),max(imus) INTO min_max_mouse FROM zoo GROUP BY time(30m) END
    ```

    The CQ `minnie_maximus` automatically calculates the 30 minute minimum of the field `mouse` and the 30 minute maximum of the field `imus` (both fields are in the measurement `zoo`), and it writes the results to the measurement `min_max_mouse`.

    > **Note:** If we create two CQs, one CQ to calculate the minimum and one CQ to calculate the maximum and we write the results to the same measurement, the data in the destination measurement may appear to be missing data.
For a complete explanation, see [Frequently Encountered Issues](/influxdb/v0.9/troubleshooting/frequently_encountered_issues/#writing-more-than-one-continuous-query-to-a-single-series).


* Create a CQ with two functions and personalize the [field keys](/influxdb/v0.9/concepts/glossary/#field-key) in the results:

    ```sql
> CREATE CONTINUOUS QUERY minnie_maximus_1 ON world BEGIN SELECT min(mouse) AS minuscule,max(imus) AS monstrous INTO min_max_mouse FROM zoo GROUP BY time(30m) END
    ```

    The CQ `minnie_maximus_1` acts in the same way as `minnie_maximus`, however, InfluxDB names field keys `miniscule` and `monstrous` in the destination measurement instead of `min` and `max`.
For more on `AS`, see [Functions](/influxdb/v0.9/query_language/functions/#rename-the-output-column-s-title-with-as).

### CQs with backreferencing
Use `:MEASUREMENT` in the `INTO` statement to backreference measurement names:
```sql
CREATE CONTINUOUS QUERY <cq_name> ON <database_name> BEGIN SELECT <function>(<stuff>)[,<function>(<stuff>)] INTO <database_name>.<retention_policy>.:MEASUREMENT FROM </relevant_measurement(s)/> [WHERE <stuff>] GROUP BY time(<interval>)[,<stuff>] END
```

*CQ backreferencing example:*
<br>
<br>
```sql
> CREATE CONTINUOUS QUERY elsewhere ON fantasy BEGIN SELECT mean(value) INTO reality."default".:MEASUREMENT FROM /elf/ GROUP BY time(10m) END
```
The CQ `elsewhere` automatically calculates the 10 minute average of the field `value` in each `elf` measurement in the database `fantasy`.
It writes the results to the already-existing database `reality`, preserving all of the measurement names in `fantasy`.

A sample of the data in `fantasy`:
```bash
> SHOW MEASUREMENTS
name: measurements
------------------
name
elf1
elf2
wizard
>
> SELECT * FROM elf1
name: cpu_usage_idle
--------------------
time			               value
2015-12-19T01:15:30Z	 97.76333874796951
2015-12-19T01:15:40Z	 98.3129217695576
[...]
2015-12-19T01:36:00Z	 94.71778221778222
2015-12-19T01:35:50Z	 87.8
```

A sample of the data in `reality` after `elsewhere` runs for a bit:
```bash
> SHOW MEASUREMENTS
name: measurements
------------------
name
elf1
elf2
>
> SELECT * FROM elf1
name: elf1
--------------------
time			               mean
2015-12-19T01:10:00Z	 97.11668879244841
2015-12-19T01:20:00Z	 94.50035091670394
2015-12-19T01:30:00Z	 95.99739053789172
```

## List CQs with `SHOW`
List every CQ by database with:
```sql
SHOW CONTINUOUS QUERIES
```

*Example:*

```bash
> SHOW CONTINUOUS QUERIES
name: reality
-------------
name	query

name: fantasy
-------------
name		     query
elsewhere	 CREATE CONTINUOUS QUERY elsewhere ON fantasy BEGIN SELECT mean(value) INTO reality."default".:MEASUREMENT FROM fantasy."default"./cpu/ WHERE cpu = 'cpu-total' GROUP BY time(10m) END
```

The output shows that the database `reality` has no CQs and the database `fantasy` has one CQ called `elsewhere`.

## Delete CQs with `DROP`
Delete a CQ from a specific database with:
```sql
DROP CONTINUOUS QUERY <cq_name> ON <database_name>
```

*Example:*

```bash
> DROP CONTINUOUS QUERY elsewhere ON fantasy
>
```

A successful `DROP CONTINUOUS QUERY` returns an empty response.

## Backfilling

Continuous queries on their own do not backfill data, that is, they do not compute results for data written to the database before the CQ existed.
Instead, users can backfill data with the `INTO` clause.
Unlike continuous queries, backfill queries require a `WHERE` clause with a `time` restriction.

### Examples

Here is a basic backfill example:
```sql
SELECT min(temp) as min_temp, max(temp) as max_temp INTO "reading.minmax.5m" FROM reading
WHERE time >= '2015-12-14 00:05:20' AND time < '2015-12-15 00:05:20'
GROUP BY time(5m)
```

Tags (`sensor_id` in the example below) can be used optionally in the same way as in continuous queries:
```sql
SELECT min(temp) as min_temp, max(temp) as max_temp INTO "reading.minmax.5m" FROM reading
WHERE time >= '2015-12-14 00:05:20' AND time < '2015-12-15 00:05:20'
GROUP BY time(5m), sensor_id
```

To prevent the backfill from creating a huge number of "empty" points containing only `null` values, [fill()](/influxdb/v0.9/query_language/data_exploration/#the-group-by-clause-and-fill) can be used at the end of the query:
```sql
SELECT min(temp) as min_temp, max(temp) as max_temp INTO "reading.minmax.5m" FROM reading
WHERE time >= '2015-12-14 00:05:20' AND time < '2015-12-15 00:05:20'
GROUP BY time(5m), fill(none)
```

If you would like to further break down the queries and run them with even more control, you can add additional `WHERE` clauses:
```sql
SELECT min(temp) as min_temp, max(temp) as max_temp INTO "reading.minmax.5m" FROM reading
WHERE sensor_id="EG-21442" AND time >= '2015-12-14 00:05:20' AND time < '2015-12-15 00:05:20'
GROUP BY time(5m)
```

> **Note**: In InfluxDB 0.9, a point is uniquely identified by the measurement, full tag set, and timestamp.
Re-backfilling or writing another point with the same measurement, tag set, and timestamp will silently overwrite the already existing point, it will not create a duplicate.
