InfluxQL is an SQL-like query language for interacting with data in InfluxDB.
The following sections cover useful query syntax for exploring your data.

The basics:

The examples below query data using [InfluxDB's Command Line Interface (CLI)](/influxdb/v1.0/tools/shell/).
See the [Querying Data](/influxdb/v1.0/guides/querying_data/) guide for how to query data directly using the HTTP API.

#### Sample data
<br>
If you'd like to follow along with the queries in this document, see [Sample Data](/influxdb/v1.0/query_language/data_download/) for how to download and write the data to InfluxDB.

This document uses publicly available data from the [National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) Center for Operational Oceanographic Products and Services](http://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/stations.html?type=Water+Levels).
The data include water levels (ft) collected every six seconds at two stations (Santa Monica, CA (ID 9410840) and Coyote Creek, CA (ID 9414575)) over the period from August 18, 2015 through September 18, 2015.

A subsample of the data in the measurement `h2o_feet`:
```
name: h2o_feet
--------------
time			                level description	      location	       water_level
2015-08-18T00:00:00Z	  between 6 and 9 feet	   coyote_creek	   8.12
2015-08-18T00:00:00Z	  below 3 feet		          santa_monica	   2.064
2015-08-18T00:06:00Z	  between 6 and 9 feet	   coyote_creek	   8.005
2015-08-18T00:06:00Z	  below 3 feet		          santa_monica	   2.116
2015-08-18T00:12:00Z	  between 6 and 9 feet	   coyote_creek	   7.887
2015-08-18T00:12:00Z	  below 3 feet		          santa_monica	   2.028
2015-08-18T00:18:00Z	  between 6 and 9 feet	   coyote_creek	   7.762
2015-08-18T00:18:00Z	  below 3 feet		          santa_monica	   2.126
2015-08-18T00:24:00Z	  between 6 and 9 feet	   coyote_creek	   7.635
2015-08-18T00:24:00Z	  below 3 feet		          santa_monica	   2.041
```

The data are made up of the [measurement](/influxdb/v1.0/concepts/glossary/#measurement) `h2o_feet` and the [tag key](/influxdb/v1.0/concepts/glossary/#tag-key) `location` with the [tag values](/influxdb/v1.0/concepts/glossary/#tag-value) `santa_monica` and `coyote_creek`.
There are two [fields](/influxdb/v1.0/concepts/glossary/#field): `water_level` which stores floats and `level description` which stores strings.
All of the data are in the `NOAA_water_database` database.

> **Disclaimer:** The `level description` field isn't part of the original NOAA data - we snuck it in there for the sake of having a field key with a special character and string [field values](/influxdb/v1.0/concepts/glossary/#field-value).

## The SELECT statement and the `WHERE` clause
InfluxQL's `SELECT` statement follows the form of an SQL `SELECT` statement where the `WHERE` clause is optional:
```sql
SELECT <stuff> FROM <measurement_name> WHERE <some_conditions>
```  

### The basic `SELECT` statement
---
The following four examples return everything from the measurement `h2o_feet` (see the CLI response at the end of this section).
While they all return the same result, they get to that result in slightly different ways and serve to introduce some of the specifics of the `SELECT` syntax:

**A**
```sql
> SELECT * FROM "h2o_feet"
```  
**B**
```sql
> SELECT "level description","location","water_level" FROM "h2o_feet"
```  
**C**
```sql
> SELECT "level description"::field,"location"::tag,"water_level"::field FROM "h2o_feet"
```
**D**
 ```sql
 > SELECT * FROM "NOAA_water_database"."autogen"."h2o_feet"
 ```

Query **A** selects [everything](/influxdb/v1.0/troubleshooting/frequently_encountered_issues/#querying-select-with-field-type-discrepancies)
from `h2o_feet` with `*`.

Queries **B** and **C** select everything from `h2o_feet` by specifying each tag
key and field key in the measurement.
Things to note:

* Separate multiple fields and tags of interest with a comma.
* You must specify at least one field in the `SELECT` statement.
* While not always necessary, we recommend that you double quote identifiers.
Identifiers **must** be double quoted if they contain characters other than `[A-z,0-9,_]`, or if they are an [InfluxQL keyword](https://github.com/influxdb/influxdb/blob/master/influxql/README.md#keywords).
Identifiers are database names, retention policy names, user names, measurement names, tag keys, and field keys.

Query **C** specifies if the identifier is a field or tag by including the
syntax `<identifier>::<field>` or `<identifier>::<tag>`.
Include this syntax to differentiate between field keys and tag keys that have
the same name.
In addition, you can specify a field's [type](/influxdb/v1.0/write_protocols/write_syntax/#data-types) with the syntax
`<field_key>::<type>`.
We'll go into detail about this functionality in the
[casting section](#data-types-and-cast-operations-in-queries) of this document.

Query **D** selects everything from `h2o_feet` by fully qualifying the measurement
`h2o_feet`.
Fully qualify a measurement by specifying its database and
[retention policy](/influxdb/v1.0/concepts/glossary/#retention-policy-rp) in
the following form: `"<database>"."<retention policy>"."<measurement>"`.
Fully qualify a measurement if you wish to query data from a different database
or from a retention policy other than the `DEFAULT`
retention policy.

The CLI response for all four queries:
 ```
name: h2o_feet
--------------
time			                level description	      location	       water_level
2015-08-18T00:00:00Z	  between 6 and 9 feet	   coyote_creek	   8.12
2015-08-18T00:00:00Z	  below 3 feet		          santa_monica	   2.064
2015-08-18T00:06:00Z	  between 6 and 9 feet	   coyote_creek	   8.005
2015-08-18T00:06:00Z	  below 3 feet		          santa_monica	   2.116
[...]
2015-09-18T21:24:00Z	  between 3 and 6 feet	   santa_monica	   5.013
2015-09-18T21:30:00Z	  between 3 and 6 feet	   santa_monica	   5.01
2015-09-18T21:36:00Z	  between 3 and 6 feet	   santa_monica	   5.066
2015-09-18T21:42:00Z	  between 3 and 6 feet	   santa_monica	   4.938
```

### The `SELECT` statement and arithmetic
---
Perform basic arithmetic operations on fields that store floats and integers.

Add two to the field `water_level`:
```sql
> SELECT "water_level" + 2 FROM "h2o_feet"
```
CLI response:
```bash
name: h2o_feet
--------------
time
2015-08-18T00:00:00Z	10.12
2015-08-18T00:00:00Z	4.064
[...]
2015-09-18T21:36:00Z	7.066
2015-09-18T21:42:00Z	6.938
```

Another example that works:
```sql
> SELECT ("water_level" * 2) + 4 from "h2o_feet"
```
CLI response:
```bash
name: h2o_feet
--------------
time
2015-08-18T00:00:00Z	20.24
2015-08-18T00:00:00Z	8.128
[...]
2015-09-18T21:36:00Z	14.132
2015-09-18T21:42:00Z	13.876
```

> **Note:** When performing arithmetic on fields that store integers be aware that InfluxDB casts those integers to floats for all mathematical operations.
This can lead to [overflow issues](/influxdb/v1.0/troubleshooting/frequently_encountered_issues/#working-with-really-big-or-really-small-integers) for some numbers.

### The `WHERE` clause
---
Use a `WHERE` clause to filter your data based on tags, time ranges, and/or field values.

> **Note:** The quoting syntax for queries differs from the [line protocol](/influxdb/v1.0/concepts/glossary/#line-protocol).
Please review the [rules for single and double-quoting](/influxdb/v1.0/troubleshooting/frequently_encountered_issues/#single-quoting-and-double-quoting-in-queries) in queries.

**Tags**  
Return data where the tag key `location` has the tag value `santa_monica`:  
```sql
> SELECT "water_level" FROM "h2o_feet" WHERE "location" = 'santa_monica'
```
* Always single quote tag values in queries - they are strings.
Note that double quotes do not work when specifying tag values and can cause queries to silently fail.


> **Note:** Tags are indexed so queries on tag keys or tag values are more performant than queries on fields.

Return data where the tag key `location` has no tag value (more on regular expressions [later](/influxdb/v1.0/query_language/data_exploration/#regular-expressions-in-queries)):
```sql
> SELECT * FROM "h2o_feet" WHERE "location" !~ /./
```

Return data where the tag key `location` has a value:
```sql
> SELECT * FROM "h2o_feet" WHERE "location" =~ /./
```
**Time ranges**  
Return data from the past seven days:
```sql
> SELECT * FROM "h2o_feet" WHERE time > now() - 7d
```
* `now()` is the Unix time of the server at the time the query is executed on that server.
For more on `now()` and other ways to specify time in queries, see [time syntax in queries](/influxdb/v1.0/query_language/data_exploration/#time-syntax-in-queries).

**Field values**  
Return data where the tag key `location` has the tag value `coyote_creek` and the field `water_level` is greater than 8 feet:
```sql
> SELECT * FROM "h2o_feet" WHERE "location" = 'coyote_creek' AND  "water_level" > 8
```
Return data where the tag key `location` has the tag value `santa_monica` and the field `level description` equals `'below 3 feet'`:
```sql
> SELECT * FROM "h2o_feet" WHERE "location" = 'santa_monica' AND "level description" = 'below 3 feet'
```
Return data where the field values in `water_level` plus `2` are greater than `11.9`:
```sql
> SELECT * FROM "h2o_feet" WHERE "water_level" + 2 > 11.9
```

* Always single quote field values that are strings.
Note that double quotes do not work when specifying string field values and can cause queries to silently fail.

> **Note:** Fields are not indexed; queries on fields are not as performant as those on tags.

More on the `WHERE` clause in InfluxQL:

* The `WHERE` clause supports comparisons against strings, booleans, floats, integers, and against the `time` of the timestamp.
It supports using regular expressions to match tags, but not to match fields.
* Chain logic together using `AND`  and `OR`, and separate using `(` and `)`.
* Acceptable comparators include:  
`=` equal to  
`<>` not equal to  
`!=` not equal to  
`>` greater than  
`<` less than  
`=~` matches against  
`!~` doesn't match against  

## The GROUP BY clause

Use the `GROUP BY` clause to group data by tags and/or time intervals.
To successfully implement `GROUP BY`,  append the`GROUP BY` clause to a `SELECT` statement and pair the `SELECT` statement with one of InfluxQL's [functions](/influxdb/v1.0/query_language/functions/):

> **Note:** If your query includes both a `WHERE` clause and a `GROUP BY` clause, the `GROUP BY` clause must come after the `WHERE` clause.

### GROUP BY tag values
Calculate the [`MEAN()`](/influxdb/v1.0/query_language/functions/#mean) `water_level` for the different tag values of `location`:
```sql
> SELECT MEAN("water_level") FROM "h2o_feet" GROUP BY "location"
```
CLI response:
```bash
name: h2o_feet
tags: location=coyote_creek
time			               mean
----			               ----
1970-01-01T00:00:00Z	 5.359342451341401


name: h2o_feet
tags: location=santa_monica
time			               mean
----			               ----
1970-01-01T00:00:00Z	 3.530863470081006
```
>**Note:** In InfluxDB, [epoch 0](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time) (`1970-01-01T00:00:00Z`) is often used as a null timestamp equivalent.
If you request a query that has no timestamp to return, such as an aggregation function with an unbounded time range, InfluxDB returns epoch 0 as the timestamp.

Calculate the [`MEAN()`](/influxdb/v1.0/query_language/functions/#mean) `index` for every tag set in `h2o_quality`:
```sql
> SELECT MEAN("index") FROM "h2o_quality" GROUP BY *
```
CLI response:
```bash
name: h2o_quality
tags: location=coyote_creek, randtag=1
time			               mean
----			               ----
1970-01-01T00:00:00Z	 50.55405446521169


name: h2o_quality
tags: location=coyote_creek, randtag=2

tags: location=coyote_creek, randtag=3
time			               mean
----			               ----

```

### GROUP BY time intervals

Users can group data by a given time interval with `GROUP BY time()`:
```sql
SELECT <function>(<field_key>) FROM <measurement_name> WHERE <time_range> GROUP BY time(<time_interval>[,<offset_interval>])
```

InfluxQL requires a `WHERE` clause if you're using `GROUP BY` with `time()`.
Note that unless you specify a different upper and lower bound for the time range, `GROUP BY` uses `epoch 0` as the lower bound and `now()` as the upper bound for the query.

Valid units for `time()` are:  
<br>
    `u` microseconds    
    `ms` milliseconds  
    `s` seconds  
    `m` minutes  
    `h` hours  
    `d` days  
    `w` weeks  

#### Rounded `GROUP BY time()` boundaries

By default, `GROUP BY time()` returns results that fall on rounded calendar time
boundaries.

Example:

[`COUNT()`](/influxdb/v1.0/query_language/functions/#count) the number of `water_level` points between August 19, 2015 at midnight and August 27 at 5:00pm at three day intervals:
```sql
> SELECT COUNT("water_level") FROM "h2o_feet" WHERE time >= '2015-08-19T00:00:00Z' AND time <= '2015-08-27T17:00:00Z' AND "location"='coyote_creek' GROUP BY time(3d)
```

CLI response:
```bash
name: h2o_feet
--------------
time			               count
2015-08-18T00:00:00Z	 480
2015-08-21T00:00:00Z	 720
2015-08-24T00:00:00Z	 720
2015-08-27T00:00:00Z	 171
```

Each timestamp represents a three day interval and the value in the `count` field is the number of `water_level` points that occur in that three day interval.
You could get the same results by querying the data four times - that is, one `COUNT()` query for every three days between August 19, 2015 at midnight and August 27, 2015 at 5:00pm - but that could take a while.

Notice that the first timestamp in the CLI response (`2015-08-18T00:00:00Z`) occurs before the lower bound of the query's time range (`2015-08-19T00:00:00Z`).
This is because default `GROUP BY time()` intervals fall on rounded
calendar time boundaries.
The `count` results where `time` is `2015-08-18T00:00:00Z`, however, only
include data from `2015-08-19T00:00:00Z`.
See [Frequently Encountered Issues](/influxdb/v1.0/troubleshooting/frequently_encountered_issues/#understanding-the-time-intervals-returned-from-group-by-time-queries) for more detailed explanation of the default
`GROUP BY time()` behavior.

#### Configured `GROUP BY time()` boundaries

`GROUP BY time()` also allows you to alter the default rounded calendar time
boundaries by including an offset interval.

Examples:

[`COUNT()`](/influxdb/v1.0/query_language/functions/#count) the number of `water_level` points between August 19, 2015 at midnight and August 27 at 5:00pm at three day intervals, and offset
the time boundary by one day:
```sql
> SELECT COUNT("water_level") FROM "h2o_feet" WHERE time >= '2015-08-19T00:00:00Z' AND time <= '2015-08-27T17:00:00Z' AND "location"='coyote_creek' GROUP BY time(3d,1d)
```

CLI response:
```
name: h2o_feet
--------------
time			               count
2015-08-19T00:00:00Z	 720
2015-08-22T00:00:00Z	 720
2015-08-25T00:00:00Z	 651
```

The `1d` offset interval alters the default three day time interval boundaries  
from:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to:
```
August 18 - August 20         August 19 - August 21
August 21 - August 23         August 22 - August 24
August 24 - August 26         August 25 - August 27
August 27 - August 29         
```

[`COUNT()`](/influxdb/v1.0/query_language/functions/#count) the number of
`water_level` points between August 19, 2015 at midnight and August 27 at 5:00pm
at three day intervals, and offset
the time boundary by -2 days:
```sql
> SELECT COUNT("water_level") FROM "h2o_feet" WHERE time >= '2015-08-19T00:00:00Z' AND time <= '2015-08-27T17:00:00Z' AND "location"='coyote_creek' GROUP BY time(3d,-2d)
```

CLI response:
```
name: h2o_feet

The  `-2d` offset interval alters the default three day time interval boundaries  
from:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

August 24 - August 26         August 22 - August 24
August 27 - August 29         August 25 - August 27
```
InfluxDB does not return results for the first time interval
(August 16 - August 18), because it is completely outside the time range in the
query's `WHERE` clause.

### GROUP BY tag values AND a time interval

Separate multiple `GROUP BY` arguments with a comma.

Calculate the average `water_level` for the different tag values of `location` in the last two weeks at 6 hour intervals:
```sql
> SELECT MEAN("water_level") FROM "h2o_feet" WHERE time > now() - 2w GROUP BY "location",time(6h)
```

### The `GROUP BY` clause and `fill()`
---
By default, a `GROUP BY` interval with no data has `null` as its value in the output column.
Use `fill()` to change the value reported for intervals that have no data.
`fill()` options include:

* Any numerical value
* `null` - sets `null` as the value for intervals with no data
* `previous` - copies the value from the previous interval for intervals with no data
* `none` - skips intervals with no data to report

Follow the ✨ in the examples below to see what `fill()` can do.

**GROUP BY without fill()**
```sql
> SELECT MEAN("water_level") FROM "h2o_feet" WHERE time >= '2015-08-18' AND time < '2015-09-24' GROUP BY time(10d)
```
CLI response:
```bash
name: h2o_feet

✨2015-09-22T00:00:00Z
```
**GROUP BY with fill()**  
Use `fill()` with `-100`:  
```sql
> SELECT MEAN("water_level") FROM h2o_feet WHERE time >= '2015-08-18' AND time < '2015-09-24' GROUP BY time(10d) fill(-100)
```
CLI response:  
```bash

✨2015-09-22T00:00:00Z	  -100
```
Use `fill()` with `none`:
```sql
> SELECT MEAN("water_level") FROM "h2o_feet" WHERE time >= '2015-08-18' AND time < '2015-09-24' GROUP BY time(10d) fill(none)

2015-09-12T00:00:00Z	   4.701986209010121
✨
```

> **Notes:**
>
* `fill()` must go at the end of the `GROUP BY` clause if you're `GROUP(ing) BY` several things (for example, both tags and a time interval).
* `fill(previous)` doesn’t fill the result for a time bucket if the previous value is outside the query’s time range. See [Frequently Encountered Issues](/influxdb/v1.0/troubleshooting/frequently_encountered_issues/#getting-empty-results-with-fill-previous) for more information.

## The INTO clause
### Relocate data
Copy data to another database, retention policy, and measurement with the `INTO` clause:
```sql
SELECT <field_key> INTO <different_measurement> FROM <current_measurement> [WHERE <stuff>] [GROUP BY <stuff>]
```

Write the field `water_level` in `h2o_feet` to a new measurement (`h2o_feet_copy`) in the same database:
```sql
> SELECT "water_level" INTO "h2o_feet_copy" FROM "h2o_feet" WHERE "location" = 'coyote_creek'
```

The CLI response shows the number of points that InfluxDB wrote to `h2o_feet_copy`:
```
name: result
------------
time			               written
1970-01-01T00:00:00Z	 7604
```

Write the field `water_level` in `h2o_feet` to a new measurement (`h2o_feet_copy`) and to the retention policy `autogen` in the [already-existing](/influxdb/v1.0/query_language/database_management/#create-a-database-with-create-database) database `where_else`:
```sql
> SELECT "water_level" INTO "where_else"."autogen"."h2o_feet_copy" FROM "h2o_feet" WHERE "location" = 'coyote_creek'
```

CLI response:
```bash
name: result
------------
time			               written
1970-01-01T00:00:00Z	 7604
```

> **Note**: If you use `SELECT *` with `INTO`, the query converts tags in the current measurement to fields in the new measurement.
This can cause InfluxDB to overwrite points that were previously differentiated by a tag value.
Use `GROUP BY <tag_key>` to preserve tags as tags.

### Downsample data
Combine the `INTO` clause with an InfluxQL [function](/influxdb/v1.0/query_language/functions/) and a `GROUP BY` clause to write the lower precision query results to a different measurement:
```sql
SELECT <function>(<field_key>) INTO <different_measurement> FROM <current_measurement> WHERE <stuff> GROUP BY <stuff>
```

> **Note:** The `INTO` queries in this section downsample old data, that is, data that have already been written to InfluxDB.
If you want InfluxDB to automatically query and downsample all future data see [Continuous Queries](/influxdb/v1.0/query_language/continuous_queries/).

Calculate the average `water_level` in `santa_monica`, and write the results to a new measurement (`average`) in the same database:
```sql
> SELECT MEAN("water_level") INTO "average" FROM "h2o_feet" WHERE "location" = 'santa_monica' AND time >= '2015-08-18T00:00:00Z' AND time <= '2015-08-18T00:30:00Z' GROUP BY time(12m)
```

The CLI response shows the number of points that InfluxDB wrote to the new measurement:
```bash
name: result
------------
time			               written
1970-01-01T00:00:00Z	 3
```

To see the query results, select everything from the new measurement `average` in `NOAA_water_database`:
```bash
> SELECT * FROM "average"
name: average
-------------
time			               mean
2015-08-18T00:00:00Z	 2.09
2015-08-18T00:12:00Z	 2.077
2015-08-18T00:24:00Z	 2.0460000000000003
```

Calculate the average `water_level` and the max `water_level` in `santa_monica`, and write the results to a new measurement (`aggregates`) in a different database (`where_else`):
```sql
> SELECT MEAN("water_level"), max("water_level") INTO "where_else"."autogen"."aggregates" FROM "h2o_feet" WHERE "location" = 'santa_monica' AND time >= '2015-08-18T00:00:00Z' AND time <= '2015-08-18T00:30:00Z' GROUP BY time(12m)
```

CLI response:
```bash
name: result
------------
time			               written
1970-01-01T00:00:00Z	 3
```

Select everything from the new measurement `aggregates` in the database `where_else`:
```bash
> SELECT * FROM "where_else"."autogen"."aggregates"
name: aggregates
----------------
time			               max	   mean
2015-08-18T00:00:00Z	 2.116	 2.09
2015-08-18T00:12:00Z	 2.126	 2.077
2015-08-18T00:24:00Z	 2.051	 2.0460000000000003
```

Calculate the average `degrees` for all temperature measurements (`h2o_temperature` and `average_temperature`) in the `NOAA_water_database` and write the results to new measurements with the same names in a different database (`where_else`).
`:MEASUREMENT` tells InfluxDB to write the query results to measurements with the same names as those targeted by the query:
```sql
> SELECT MEAN("degrees") INTO "where_else"."autogen".:MEASUREMENT FROM /temperature/ WHERE time >= '2015-08-18T00:00:00Z' AND time <= '2015-08-18T00:30:00Z' GROUP BY time(12m)
```

CLI response:
```bash
name: result
------------
time			               written
1970-01-01T00:00:00Z	 6
```

Select the `mean` field from all new temperature measurements in the database `where_else`.
```bash
> SELECT "mean" FROM "where_else"."autogen"./temperature/
name: average_temperature
-------------------------
time			               mean
2015-08-18T00:00:00Z	 78.5
2015-08-18T00:12:00Z	 84
2015-08-18T00:24:00Z	 74.75

name: h2o_temperature
---------------------
time			                mean
2015-08-18T00:00:00Z	  63.75
2015-08-18T00:12:00Z	  63.5
2015-08-18T00:24:00Z	  63.5
```

More on downsampling with `INTO`:

* InfluxDB does not store null values.
Depending on the frequency of your data, the query results may be missing time intervals.
Use [fill()](/influxdb/v1.0/query_language/data_exploration/#the-group-by-clause-and-fill) to ensure that every time interval appears in the results.
* The number of writes in the CLI response includes one write for every time interval in the query's time range even if there is no data for some of the time intervals.

## Limit query returns with LIMIT and SLIMIT
InfluxQL supports two different clauses to limit your query results:

* `LIMIT <N>` returns the first \<N> [points](/influxdb/v1.0/concepts/glossary/#point) from each [metaseries](/influxdb/v1.0/concepts/glossary/#metaseries) in the specified measurement.
* `SLIMIT <N>` returns every point from \<N> metaseries in the specified measurement.
* `LIMIT <N>` followed by `SLIMIT <N>` returns the first \<N> points from \<N> metaseries in the specified measurement.

### Limit the number of results returned per metaseries with `LIMIT`
---
Use `LIMIT <N>` with `SELECT` and `GROUP BY *` to return the first \<N> points from each [metaseries](/influxdb/v1.0/concepts/glossary/#metaseries).

Return the three oldest points from each metaseries associated with the measurement `h2o_feet`:
```sql
> SELECT "water_level" FROM "h2o_feet" GROUP BY * LIMIT 3
```

CLI response:
```bash
name: h2o_feet
tags: location=coyote_creek
time			              water_level
----			              -----------
2015-08-18T00:00:00Z	8.12
2015-08-18T00:06:00Z	8.005
2015-08-18T00:12:00Z	7.887

name: h2o_feet
tags: location=santa_monica
time			              water_level
----			              -----------
2015-08-18T00:00:00Z	2.064
2015-08-18T00:06:00Z	2.116
2015-08-18T00:12:00Z	2.028
```

> **Note:** If \<N> is greater than the number of points in the metaseries, InfluxDB returns all points in the metaseries.

### Limit the number of metaseries returned with `SLIMIT`
---
Use `SLIMIT <N>` with `SELECT` and `GROUP BY *` to return every point from \<N> [metaseries](/influxdb/v1.0/concepts/glossary/#metaseries).

Return everything from one of the metaseries associated with the measurement `h2o_feet`:
```sql
> SELECT "water_level" FROM "h2o_feet" GROUP BY * SLIMIT 1
```

CLI response:
```bash
name: h2o_feet
tags: location=coyote_creek
time			              water_level
----			              -----
2015-08-18T00:00:00Z	8.12
2015-08-18T00:06:00Z	8.005
2015-08-18T00:12:00Z	7.887
[...]
2015-09-18T16:12:00Z	3.402
2015-09-18T16:18:00Z	3.314
2015-09-18T16:24:00Z	3.235
```

> **Note:** If \<N> is greater than the number of metaseries associated with the specified measurement, InfluxDB returns all points from every metaseries.

### Limit the number of points and metaseries returned with `LIMIT` and `SLIMIT`
---
Use `LIMIT <N1>` followed by `SLIMIT <N2>` with `GROUP BY *` to return \<N1> points from \<N2> [metaseries](/influxdb/v1.0/concepts/glossary/#metaseries).

Return the three oldest points from one of the metaseries associated with the measurement `h2o_feet`:
```sql
> SELECT "water_level" FROM "h2o_feet" GROUP BY * LIMIT 3 SLIMIT 1
```

CLI response:
```bash
name: h2o_feet
tags: location=coyote_creek
time			               water_level
----			               -----------
2015-08-18T00:00:00Z	 8.12
2015-08-18T00:06:00Z	 8.005
2015-08-18T00:12:00Z	 7.887
```

> **Note:** If \<N1> is greater than the number of points in the metaseries, InfluxDB returns all points in the metaseries.
If \<N2> is greater than the number of metaseries associated with the specified measurement, InfluxDB returns points from every metaseries.

## Sort query returns with ORDER BY time DESC
By default, InfluxDB returns results in ascending time order - so the first points that are returned are the oldest points by timestamp.
Use `ORDER BY time DESC` to see the newest points by timestamp.

Return the oldest five points from one series **without** `ORDER BY time DESC`:  
```sql
> SELECT "water_level" FROM "h2o_feet" WHERE "location" = 'santa_monica' LIMIT 5
```

CLI response:  
```bash
name: h2o_feet
----------
time			water_level
2015-08-18T00:00:00Z	2.064
2015-08-18T00:06:00Z	2.116
2015-08-18T00:12:00Z	2.028
2015-08-18T00:18:00Z	2.126
2015-08-18T00:24:00Z	2.041
```

Now include  `ORDER BY time DESC` to get the newest five points from the same series:  
```sql
> SELECT "water_level" FROM "h2o_feet" WHERE "location" = 'santa_monica' ORDER BY time DESC LIMIT 5
```

CLI response:  
```bash
name: h2o_feet
----------
time			water_level
2015-09-18T21:42:00Z	4.938
2015-09-18T21:36:00Z	5.066
2015-09-18T21:30:00Z	5.01
2015-09-18T21:24:00Z	5.013
2015-09-18T21:18:00Z	5.072
```

Finally, use `GROUP BY` with `ORDER BY time DESC` to return the last five points from each series:  
```sql
> SELECT "water_level" FROM "h2o_feet" GROUP BY "location" ORDER BY time DESC LIMIT 5
```

CLI response:
```bash
name: h2o_feet
tags: location=santa_monica
time			               water_level
----			               -----------
2015-09-18T21:42:00Z	 4.938
2015-09-18T21:36:00Z	 5.066
2015-09-18T21:30:00Z	 5.01
2015-09-18T21:24:00Z	 5.013
2015-09-18T21:18:00Z	 5.072

name: h2o_feet
tags: location=coyote_creek
time			               water_level
----			               -----------
2015-09-18T16:24:00Z	 3.235
2015-09-18T16:18:00Z	 3.314
2015-09-18T16:12:00Z	 3.402
2015-09-18T16:06:00Z	 3.497
2015-09-18T16:00:00Z	 3.599
```

## Paginate query returns with OFFSET and SOFFSET

### Use `OFFSET` to paginate the results returned
---
For example, get the first three points written to a series:

```sql
> SELECT "water_level" FROM "h2o_feet" WHERE "location" = 'coyote_creek' LIMIT 3
```

CLI response:  
```bash
name: h2o_feet
----------
time			               water_level
2015-08-18T00:00:00Z	 8.12
2015-08-18T00:06:00Z	 8.005
2015-08-18T00:12:00Z	 7.887
```

Then get the second three points from that same series:

```sql
> SELECT "water_level" FROM "h2o_feet" WHERE "location" = 'coyote_creek' LIMIT 3 OFFSET 3
```

CLI response:
```bash
name: h2o_feet
----------
time			               water_level
2015-08-18T00:18:00Z	 7.762
2015-08-18T00:24:00Z	 7.635
2015-08-18T00:30:00Z	 7.5
```

### Use `SOFFSET` to paginate the metaseries returned
---

For example, get the first three points from one [metaseries](/influxdb/v1.0/concepts/glossary/#metaseries):
```sql
> SELECT "water_level" FROM "h2o_feet" GROUP BY * LIMIT 3 SLIMIT 1
```

CLI response:
```
name: h2o_feet
tags: location=coyote_creek
time			               water_level
----			               -----------
2015-08-18T00:00:00Z	 8.12
2015-08-18T00:06:00Z	 8.005
2015-08-18T00:12:00Z	 7.887
```

Then get the first three points from the next metaseries:
```sql
> SELECT "water_level" FROM "h2o_feet" GROUP BY * LIMIT 3 SLIMIT 1 SOFFSET 1
```

CLI response:
```
name: h2o_feet
tags: location=santa_monica
time			               water_level
----			               -----------
2015-08-18T00:00:00Z	 2.064
2015-08-18T00:06:00Z	 2.116
2015-08-18T00:12:00Z	 2.028
```

## Multiple statements in queries

Separate multiple statements in a query with a semicolon.
For example:
<br>
<br>
```sql
> SELECT MEAN("water_level") FROM "h2o_feet" WHERE time > now() - 2w GROUP BY "location",time(24h) fill(none); SELECT COUNT("water_level") FROM "h2o_feet" WHERE time > now() - 2w GROUP BY "location",time(24h) fill(80)
```

## Merge metaseries in queries

In InfluxDB, queries merge [metaseries](/influxdb/v1.0/concepts/glossary/#metaseries) automatically.

The `NOAA_water_database` database has two metaseries.
The first metaseries is made up of the measurement `h2o_feet` and the tag key `location` with the tag value `coyote_creek`.
The second metaseries is made of up the measurement `h2o_feet` and the tag key `location` with the tag value `santa_monica`.

The following query automatically merges those two metaseries when it calculates the [average](/influxdb/v1.0/query_language/functions/#mean) `water_level`:

```sql
> SELECT MEAN("water_level") FROM "h2o_feet"
```

CLI response:
```bash
name: h2o_feet
--------------
time			               mean
1970-01-01T00:00:00Z	 4.442107025822521
```

If you only want the `MEAN()` `water_level` for the first metaseries, specify the tag set in the `WHERE` clause:
```sql
> SELECT MEAN("water_level") FROM "h2o_feet" WHERE "location" = 'coyote_creek'
```

CLI response:
```bash
name: h2o_feet
--------------
time			               mean
1970-01-01T00:00:00Z	 5.359342451341401
```

> **NOTE:** In InfluxDB, [epoch 0](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time) (`1970-01-01T00:00:00Z`) is often used as a null timestamp equivalent.
If you request a query that has no timestamp to return, such as an aggregation function with an unbounded time range, InfluxDB returns epoch 0 as the timestamp.

## Time syntax in queries  
InfluxDB is a time series database so, unsurprisingly, InfluxQL has a lot to do with specifying time ranges.
If you do not specify start and end times in your query, they default to epoch 0 (`1970-01-01T00:00:00Z`) and `now()`.
The following sections detail how to specify different start and end times in queries.

### Relative time
---
`now()` is the Unix time of the server at the time the query is executed on that server.
Use `now()` to calculate a timestamp relative to the server's
current timestamp.

Query data starting an hour ago and ending `now()`:
```sql
> SELECT "water_level" FROM "h2o_feet" WHERE time > now() - 1h
```

Query data that occur between epoch 0 and 1,000 days from `now()`:  
```sql
> SELECT "level description" FROM "h2o_feet" WHERE time < now() + 1000d
```

* Note the whitespace between the operator and the time duration.
Leaving that whitespace out can cause InfluxDB to return no results or an `error parsing query` error .

The other options for specifying time durations with `now()` are listed below.  
`u` microseconds  
`ms` milliseconds  
`s` seconds  
`m` minutes  
`h` hours  
`d` days  
`w` weeks   

### Absolute time
---
#### Date time strings
Specify time with date time strings.
Date time strings can take two formats: `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS.nnnnnnnnn` and  `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS.nnnnnnnnnZ`, where the second specification is [RFC3339](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3339.txt).
Nanoseconds (`nnnnnnnnn`) are optional in both formats.

Examples:

Query data between August 18, 2015 23:00:01.232000000 and September 19, 2015 00:00:00 with the timestamp syntax `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS.nnnnnnnnn` and  `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS.nnnnnnnnnZ`:

```sql
> SELECT "water_level" FROM "h2o_feet" WHERE time > '2015-08-18 23:00:01.232000000' AND time < '2015-09-19'
```
```sql
> SELECT "water_level" FROM "h2o_feet" WHERE time > '2015-08-18T23:00:01.232000000Z' AND time < '2015-09-19'
```

Query data that occur 6 minutes after September 18, 2015 21:24:00:

```sql
> SELECT "water_level" FROM "h2o_feet" WHERE time > '2015-09-18T21:24:00Z' + 6m
```

Things to note about querying with date time strings:

* Single quote the date time string.
InfluxDB returns as error (`ERR: invalid operation: time and *influxql.VarRef are not compatible`) if you double quote the date time string.
* If you only specify the date, InfluxDB sets the time to `00:00:00`.

#### Epoch time
Specify time with timestamps in epoch time.
Epoch time is the number of nanoseconds that have elapsed since 00:00:00 Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), Thursday, 1 January 1970.
Indicate the units of the timestamp at the end of the timestamp (see the section above for a list of acceptable time units).

Examples:

Return all points that occur after  `2014-01-01 00:00:00`:  
```sql
> SELECT * FROM "h2o_feet" WHERE time > 1388534400s
```

Return all points that occur 6 minutes after `2015-09-18 21:24:00`:

```sql
> SELECT * FROM "h2o_feet" WHERE time > 24043524m + 6m
```

> **Note**: Currently, InfluxDB does not support using `OR` with absolute time
in the `WHERE` clause.
See [Frequently Encountered Issues](/influxdb/v1.0/troubleshooting/frequently_encountered_issues/#using-or-with-absolute-time-in-the-where-clause/)
for more information.

## Regular expressions in queries

Regular expressions are surrounded by `/` characters and use [Golang's regular expression syntax](http://golang.org/pkg/regexp/syntax/).
Use regular expressions when selecting measurements and tags.

> **Note:** You cannot use regular expressions to match databases, retention policies, or fields.
You can only use regular expressions to match measurements and tags.

In this section we'll be using all of the measurements in the [sample data](/influxdb/v1.0/query_language/data_exploration/#sample-data):
`h2o_feet`, `h2o_quality`, `h2o_pH`, `average_temperature`, and `h2o_temperature`.
Please note that every measurement besides `h2o_feet` is fictional and contains fictional data.

### Data types and cast operations in queries

#### Data types

Field values can be floats, integers, strings, or booleans.
Specify the relevant field type in a `SELECT` query with the syntax
`<field_key>::<type>`.

Example:

Specify that the response should contain floats from the field
`water_level`:
```
> SELECT "water_level"::float FROM "h2o_feet" LIMIT 4
name: h2o_feet
--------------
time		                	water_level
2015-08-18T00:00:00Z	  8.12
2015-08-18T00:00:00Z	  2.064
2015-08-18T00:06:00Z	  8.005
2015-08-18T00:06:00Z	  2.116
```

> **Note:**  It is possible for field value types to differ across shards.
Please see
[Frequently Encountered Issues](/influxdb/v1.0/troubleshooting/frequently_encountered_issues/#querying-select-with-field-type-discrepancies)
for more information on how InfluxDB handles field value type discrepancies.

#### Cast Operations
The `<field_key>::<type>` syntax supports casting field values from integers to
floats or from floats to integers.
Attempting to cast a float or integer to a string or boolean yields an empty
response.

Examples:

Specify that the response should contain integers from the field `water_level`:
```
> SELECT "water_level"::integer FROM "h2o_feet" LIMIT 4
name: h2o_feet
--------------
time		                	water_level
2015-08-18T00:00:00Z	  8
2015-08-18T00:00:00Z	  2
2015-08-18T00:06:00Z	  8
2015-08-18T00:06:00Z	  2
```

Specify that the response should contain strings from the field `water_level`
(this functionality is not supported):
```
> SELECT "water_level"::string FROM "h2o_feet" LIMIT 4
>
```

### Regular expressions and selecting measurements
---
Select the oldest point from every measurement in the `NOAA_water_database` database:
```sql
> SELECT * FROM /.*/ LIMIT 1
```

CLI response:
```bash
name: average_temperature
-------------------------
time			               degrees	 index	 level description	    location	     pH	 randtag	 water_level
2015-08-18T00:00:00Z	 82					                               coyote_creek

2015-08-18T00:00:00Z			               between 6 and 9 feet	 coyote_creek			            8.12


name: h2o_pH
------------
time			               degrees	 index	 level description	    location	     pH	 randtag	 water_level

name: h2o_quality
-----------------
time			               degrees	 index	 level description	    location	     pH	 randtag	 water_level
2015-08-18T00:00:00Z		         41				                       coyote_creek		    1

---------------------
time			               degrees	 index	 level description	    location	     pH	 randtag	 water_level
2015-08-18T00:00:00Z	 60					                               coyote_creek
```

* Alternatively, `SELECT` all of the measurements in `NOAA_water_database` by typing them out and separating each name with a comma , but that could get tedious:

    ```sql
> SELECT * FROM "average_temperature","h2o_feet","h2o_pH","h2o_quality","h2o_temperature" LIMIT 1
    ```

Select the first three points from every measurement whose name starts with `h2o`:  
```sql
> SELECT * FROM /^h2o/ LIMIT 3
```
CLI response:  
```bash
name: h2o_feet
--------------

### Regular expressions and specifying tags
---
Use regular expressions to specify tags in the `WHERE` clause.
The relevant comparators include:  
`=~` matches against  
`!~` doesn't match against

Select the oldest four points from the measurement `h2o_feet` where the value of the tag `location` does not include an `a`:
```sql
> SELECT * FROM "h2o_feet" WHERE "location" !~ /.*a.*/ LIMIT 4
```

CLI response:
```bash
name: h2o_feet
--------------
time			               level description	    location	     water_level
2015-08-18T00:00:00Z	 between 6 and 9 feet 	coyote_creek	 8.12
2015-08-18T00:06:00Z	 between 6 and 9 feet	 coyote_creek	 8.005
2015-08-18T00:12:00Z	 between 6 and 9 feet	 coyote_creek	 7.887
2015-08-18T00:18:00Z	 between 6 and 9 feet	 coyote_creek	 7.762
```

Select the oldest four points from the measurement `h2o_feet` where the value of the tag `location` includes a `y` or an `m` and `water_level` is greater than zero:
```sql
> SELECT * FROM "h2o_feet" WHERE ("location" =~ /.*y.*/ OR "location" =~ /.*m.*/) AND "water_level" > 0 LIMIT 4
```
or
<br>
<br>
```sql
> SELECT * FROM "h2o_feet" WHERE "location" =~ /[ym]/ AND "water_level" > 0 LIMIT 4
```

CLI response:
```
name: h2o_feet
--------------
time			               level description	    location	     water_level
2015-08-18T00:00:00Z	 between 6 and 9 feet	 coyote_creek	 8.12
2015-08-18T00:00:00Z	 below 3 feet		        santa_monica	 2.064
2015-08-18T00:06:00Z	 between 6 and 9 feet	 coyote_creek	 8.005
2015-08-18T00:06:00Z	 below 3 feet		        santa_monica	 2.116
```

See [the WHERE clause](/influxdb/v1.0/query_language/data_exploration/#the-where-clause) section for an example of how to return data where a tag key has a value and an example of how to return data where a tag key has no value using regular expressions.
