If you're looking for `SHOW` queries (for example, `SHOW DATABASES` or `SHOW RETENTION POLICIES`), see [Schema Exploration](/influxdb/v1.0/query_language/schema_exploration).

The examples in the sections below use InfluxDB's [Command Line Interface (CLI)](/influxdb/v1.0/introduction/getting_started/).
You can also execute the commands using the HTTP API; simply  send a `GET` request to the `/query` endpoint and include the command in the URL parameter `q`.
See the [Querying Data](/influxdb/v1.0/guides/querying_data/) guide for more on using the HTTP API.

## Data Management

### Create a database with CREATE DATABASE
---
The `CREATE DATABASE` query takes the following form:
```sql
CREATE DATABASE <database_name> [WITH [DURATION <duration>] [REPLICATION <n>] [SHARD DURATION <duration>] [NAME <retention-policy-name>]]
```

> **Note:** In previous versions InfluxQL supported the `IF NOT EXISTS` clause.
The has been removed in InfluxDB version 1.0.
If you attempt to create a database that already exists, InfluxDB does not return an error.

Create the database `NOAA_water_database`:
```bash
> CREATE DATABASE "NOAA_water_database"
>
```

Create the database `NOAA_water_database` with a new `DEFAULT` retention policy called `liquid`:
```bash
> CREATE DATABASE "NOAA_water_database" WITH DURATION 3d REPLICATION 3 SHARD DURATION 30m NAME "liquid"
>
```
When specifying a retention policy you can include one or more of the attributes `DURATION`, `REPLICATION`, `SHARD DURATION`, and `NAME`.
For more on retention policies, see [Retention Policy Management](/influxdb/v1.0/query_language/database_management/#retention-policy-management)

A successful `CREATE DATABASE` query returns an empty result.
If you attempt to create a database that already exists, InfluxDB does not return an error.

### Delete a database with DROP DATABASE
---
The `DROP DATABASE` query deletes all of the data, measurements, series, continuous queries, and retention policies from the specified database.
The query takes the following form:
```sql
DROP DATABASE <database_name>
```

> **Note:** In previous versions InfluxQL supported the `IF EXISTS` clause.
The has been removed in InfluxDB version 1.0.
If you attempt to drop a database that does not exist, InfluxDB does not return an error.

Drop the database NOAA_water_database:
```bash
> DROP DATABASE "NOAA_water_database"
>
```

A successful `DROP DATABASE` query returns an empty result.
If you attempt to drop a database that does not exist, InfluxDB does not return an error.

### Drop metaseries from the index with DROP SERIES
---
The `DROP SERIES` query deletes all points from a [metaseries](/influxdb/v1.0/concepts/glossary/#metaseries) in a database,
and it drops the metaseries from the index.

> **Note:** `DROP SERIES` does not support time intervals in the `WHERE` clause.
See
[`DELETE`](/influxdb/v1.0/query_language/database_management/#delete-data-with-delete)
for that functionality.

The query takes the following form, where you must specify either the `FROM` clause or the `WHERE` clause:
```sql
DROP SERIES FROM <measurement_name[,measurement_name]> WHERE <tag_key>='<tag_value>'
```

Drop all metaseries from a single measurement:
```sql
> DROP SERIES FROM "h2o_feet"
```

Drop metaseries with a specific tag pair from a single measurement:
```sql
> DROP SERIES FROM "h2o_feet" WHERE "location" = 'santa_monica'
```

Drop all points in the metaseries that have a specific tag pair from all measurements in the database:
```sql
> DROP SERIES WHERE "location" = 'santa_monica'
```

A successful `DROP SERIES` query returns an empty result.

### Delete data with DELETE
---
The `DELETE` query deletes all specified data from a database.
Unlike
[`DROP SERIES`](/influxdb/v1.0/query_language/database_management/#drop-metaseries-from-the-index-with-drop-series), `DELETE` does not drop the [metaseries](/influxdb/v1.0/concepts/glossary/#metaseries) from the index and it supports time intervals
in the `WHERE` clause.

The query takes the following form where you must include either the `FROM`
clause or the `WHERE` clause, or both:

```
DELETE FROM <measurement_name> WHERE [<tag_key>='<tag_value>'] | [<time interval>]
```

Delete all data associated with the measurement `h2o_feet`:
```
> DELETE FROM "h2o_feet"
```

Delete all data associated with the measurement `h2o_quality` and where the tag `randtag` equals `3`:
```
> DELETE FROM "h2o_quality" WHERE "randtag" = '3'
```

Delete all data in the database that occur before January 01, 2016:
```
> DELETE WHERE time < '2016-01-01'
```

A successful `DELETE` query returns an empty result.

Things to note about `DELETE`:

* `DELETE` supports
[regular expressions](/influxdb/v1.0/query_language/data_exploration/#regular-expressions-in-queries)
in the `FROM` clause when specifying measurement names and in the `WHERE` clause
when specifying tag values.
* `DELETE` does not support [fields](/influxdb/v1.0/concepts/glossary/#field) in the `WHERE` clause.

### Delete measurements with DROP MEASUREMENT
---
The `DROP MEASUREMENT` query deletes all data and series from the specified [measurement](/influxdb/v1.0/concepts/glossary/#measurement) and deletes the
measurement from the index.

The query takes the following form:
```sql
DROP MEASUREMENT <measurement_name>
```

Delete the measurement `h2o_feet`:
```sql
> DROP MEASUREMENT "h2o_feet"
```

> **Note:** `DROP MEASUREMENT` drops all data and series in the measurement.
It does not drop the associated continuous queries.

A successful `DROP MEASUREMENT` query returns an empty result.

<dt> Currently, InfluxDB does not support regular expressions with `DROP MEASUREMENTS`.
See GitHub Issue [#4275](https://github.com/influxdb/influxdb/issues/4275) for more information.
</dt>

### Delete a shard with DROP SHARD
---
The `DROP SHARD` query deletes a shard. It also drops the shard from the
[metastore](/influxdb/v1.0/concepts/glossary/#metastore).
The query takes the following form:
```sql
DROP SHARD <shard_id_number>
```

Delete the shard with the id `1`:
```
> DROP SHARD 1
>
```

A successful `DROP SHARD` query returns an empty result.
InfluxDB does not return an error if you attempt to drop a shard that does not
exist.

## Retention Policy Management
The following sections cover how to create, alter, and delete retention policies.
Note that when you create a database, InfluxDB automatically creates a retention policy named `autogen` which has infinite retention.
You may rename that retention policy or disable its auto-creation in the [configuration file](/influxdb/v1.0/administration/config/#meta).

### Create retention policies with CREATE RETENTION POLICY
---
The `CREATE RETENTION POLICY` query takes the following form:
```sql
CREATE RETENTION POLICY <retention_policy_name> ON <database_name> DURATION <duration> REPLICATION <n> [SHARD DURATION <duration>] [DEFAULT]
```

* `DURATION` determines how long InfluxDB keeps the data.
The options for specifying the duration of the retention policy are listed below.
Note that the minimum retention period is one hour.  
`m` minutes  
`h` hours  
`d` days  
`w` weeks  
`INF` infinite

    <dt> Currently, the `DURATION` attribute supports only single units.
For example, you cannot express the duration `7230m` as `120h 30m`.
See GitHub Issue [#3634](https://github.com/influxdb/influxdb/issues/3634) for more information.
</dt>

* `REPLICATION` determines how many independent copies of each point are stored in the cluster, where `n` is the number of data nodes.

<dt> Replication factors do not serve a purpose with single node instances.
</dt>

* `SHARD DURATION` determines the time range covered by a shard group.
The options for specifying the duration of the shard group are listed below.
The default shard group duration depends on your retention policy's `DURATION`.  
`u` microseconds  
`ms` milliseconds  
`s` seconds  
`m` minutes  
`h` hours  
`d` days  
`w` weeks

<dt> Currently, the `SHARD DURATION` attribute supports only single units.
For example, you cannot express the duration `7230m` as `120h 30m`.
</dt>

* `DEFAULT` sets the new retention policy as the default retention policy for the database.

Create a retention policy called `one_day_only` for the database `NOAA_water_database` with a one day duration and a replication factor of one:
```sql
> CREATE RETENTION POLICY "one_day_only" ON "NOAA_water_database" DURATION 1d REPLICATION 1
>
```

Create the same retention policy as the one in the example above, but set it as the default retention policy for the database.
```sql
> CREATE RETENTION POLICY "one_day_only" ON "NOAA_water_database" DURATION 1d REPLICATION 1 DEFAULT
>
```

A successful `CREATE RETENTION POLICY` query returns an empty response.
If you attempt to create a retention policy that already exists, InfluxDB does not return an error.

> **Note:** You can also specify a new retention policy in the `CREATE DATABASE` query.
See [Create a database with CREATE DATABASE](/influxdb/v1.0/query_language/database_management/#create-a-database-with-create-database).

### Modify retention policies with ALTER RETENTION POLICY
---
The `ALTER RETENTION POLICY` query takes the following form, where you must declare at least one of the retention policy attributes `DURATION`, `REPLICATION`, `SHARD DURATION`, or `DEFAULT`:
```sql
ALTER RETENTION POLICY <retention_policy_name> ON <database_name> DURATION <duration> REPLICATION <n> SHARD DURATION <duration> DEFAULT
```

<dt> Replication factors do not serve a purpose with single node instances.
</dt>

First, create the retention policy `what_is_time` with a `DURATION` of two days:
```sql
> CREATE RETENTION POLICY "what_is_time" ON "NOAA_water_database" DURATION 2d REPLICATION 1
>
```

Modify `what_is_time` to have a three week `DURATION`, a 30 minute shard group duration, and  make it the `DEFAULT` retention policy for `NOAA_water_database`.
```sql
> ALTER RETENTION POLICY "what_is_time" ON "NOAA_water_database" DURATION 3w SHARD DURATION 30m DEFAULT
>
```
In the last example, `what_is_time` retains its original replication factor of 1.

A successful `ALTER RETENTION POLICY` query returns an empty result.

### Delete retention policies with DROP RETENTION POLICY
Delete all measurements and data in a specific retention policy with:
```sql
DROP RETENTION POLICY <retention_policy_name> ON <database_name>
```

Delete the retention policy `what_is_time` in the `NOAA_water_database` database:  
```bash
> DROP RETENTION POLICY "what_is_time" ON "NOAA_water_database"
>
```

A successful `DROP RETENTION POLICY` query returns an empty result.
If you attempt to drop a retention policy that does not exist, InfluxDB does not return an error.
