# Introduction

InfluxDB periodically samples and stores metrics about its own operations. 
The metrics are stored in the `_internal` database and can be queried, downsampled, passed to Kapacitor, etc. just like any other data in the system.

The metrics in `_internal` are recorded periodically as determined by the `monitor.store-interval` configuration setting.
For a view of the internal metrics at the current instant in time, use the `SHOW STATS` query.

The internal metrics are primarily intended for debugging and tuning InfluxDB.
We do not make any guarantees about which internal metrics remain across different versions of InfluxDB.

# Metric definitions

Every measurement in `_internal` has one tag:
* `hostname` - the hostname of the instance reporting the metrics

## collectd

The `collectd` measurement tracks statistics about the collectd service.
This measurement will only be present if the collectd service plugin is enabled.
