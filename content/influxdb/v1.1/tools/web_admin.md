# Deprecated as of InfluxDB 1.1

The built-in web administration GUI is deprecated in InfluxDB 1.1 and is disabled by default. We recommend using the [HTTP API](/influxdb/v1.1/tools/api/) or the [Command Line Interface](/influxdb/v1.1/tools/shell/) to interact with InfluxDB.

## Accessing the UI

To enable the Admin UI, [edit the configuration file](/influxdb/v1.1/administration/config/#enabled-false) to set `enabled = true` in the `[admin]` section. You must restart the process for any configuration changes to take effect.

Once enabled, the Admin UI is available by default at port `8083`, i.e. [http://localhost:8083](http://localhost:8083).
You can control the port in the InfluxDB config file using the `port` option in the `[admin]` section.

You can also access remote InfluxDB instances, although you may only connect to one instance at a time.
To access an instance at a location other than than http://localhost:8083, click the `Settings` icon in the upper right and enter the proper connection settings for the target InfluxDB instance.

### HTTP vs HTTPS

The Admin UI uses HTTP by default but can be configured to use HTTPS.
In the InfluxDB config file, find the `[admin]` section and set `https-enabled = true`.

> **Note:** If HTTPS is enabled, you must explicitly connect to the instance using `https://`, there is no redirect from `http` to `https`.

### Selecting the Database

Choose your target database for writes and queries from the "Databases" pull-down menu in the upper right.
If you have recently created a database you will need to refresh the Admin UI page before it appears in the pull-down menu.

## Writing Data

The Admin UI has a "Write Data" link in the top menu bar.
This link pops up a modal dialog that will accept points in the [line protocol](/influxdb/v1.1/concepts/glossary/#line-protocol) format.

## Querying Data

The Admin UI has a "Query" box where you can enter any valid [InfluxQL](/influxdb/v1.1/query_language/spec/) command, including database administration and schema exploration commands.
The "Query Templates" pull-down menu will pre-populate the Query box with a number of common InfluxQL queries.
